16717	eng	You'd better not wait here.
16751	eng	You are, so to speak, a fish out of water.
16796	eng	You shouldn't talk back to your parents like that.
16921	eng	I'm tired of your complaints.

26797	eng	I was late because of the rain.
26804	eng	The rain spoiled our picnic.
26897	eng	Let's go back before it begins to rain.
26902	eng	I am afraid that it will rain.
26946	eng	If it rains, we will put off our practice match.

30603	eng	What if he should happen to come late?
30713	eng	Can you imagine what our life would be like without electricity?
30810	eng	If I were you, I should not do such a thing.
30906	eng	You may go home if you want to.

1955033	eng	I can't tell you how unhappy this makes me feel.
1955085	eng	I can't trust you.
1955129	eng	You can't wear that hat to school.
1955650	eng	Tom's younger brother is dumb as a brick.
1956079	eng	I only read the first four chapters.
1956111	eng	What do you want from Tom?
1959361	eng	He told him about his cats.
1961234	eng	I thought I had until 2:30.
1961283	eng	I thought I told you you didn't need to be here.
1961372	eng	I thought it was worth a try.
1961399	eng	I thought something horrible had happened.
1961447	eng	I thought Tom and Mary were crazy.
1961556	eng	I thought we could eat out on the patio.
1961753	eng	I thought you were going to quit.
1961779	eng	I thought you were trying to be funny.
1961837	eng	I thought you'd sleep until noon.
1962761	eng	I don't love him.
1963111	eng	That ship has sailed for me.
1963617	eng	This is the best thing to tell to someone who tries to learn something.
1964147	eng	Why am I studying Icelandic?
1970125	eng	I've got a friend who works for the New York Times.
1972285	eng	Please call before you come.
1972584	eng	I'm not surprised you don't know the answer.
1972596	eng	There are many people that don't like me.
1975727	eng	It's actually not that difficult.
1981044	eng	The doctor wouldn't allow me to take part in the marathon.
1981481	eng	There's something important I need to tell her.
1983864	eng	He was not sure what to do.
1987958	eng	They kept flashing that light in my eyes.
1989070	eng	Sam, no!
1989626	eng	Tom and Mary always seem to be hanging out together.
1991767	eng	There's never enough time to do everything you want to do.
1992465	eng	I can't find the newspaper.
2001697	eng	I love the Norwegian winter.
2002519	eng	The towel is dry.
2006507	eng	You and I have other fish to fry.
2007322	eng	Let's have a water balloon fight.
2007347	eng	Let's find Tom before Mary does.
2007561	eng	Let's do it after school.
2007625	eng	Let's hope it's enough.
2007644	eng	Let's talk about work.
2007694	eng	Let's just meet here.
2007716	eng	Let's get the others.
2007836	eng	Let's try it out.
2007902	eng	Let's eat here.
2007908	eng	Let's be frank.
2009289	eng	Why would anyone hide something like that inside this cave?
2009472	eng	This book is unique in many ways.
2011212	eng	Would you please tell me how to do that?
2011383	eng	Tom wants to live.
2011479	eng	I don't want credit.
2011881	eng	I just want to find Tom.
2011965	eng	Tom wanted us to see it.
2011979	eng	Who wants to talk to me?
2012090	eng	Do you want to join them?
2012116	eng	I don't want to lie down.
2012117	eng	I don't want to lose Tom.
2012162	eng	I want your legal advice.
2012512	eng	Someone wanted us to come.
2012527	eng	Tom really does want this.
2012531	eng	Tom wants a word with you.
2012648	eng	I don't want Tom to forget.
2013085	eng	What is it you want from me?
2013906	eng	I don't want to kill you, Tom.
2013932	eng	I just want to know one thing.
2014057	eng	Why would you even want to go?
2014352	eng	People don't want to hear that.
2014618	eng	Do you want that responsibility?
2014760	eng	Tom, I want to hear it from you.
2015158	eng	I don't want to do this with you.
2015242	eng	Is there anywhere you want to go?
2016611	eng	I don't want to go back to prison.
2016734	eng	What is it you want to sell to us?
2016872	eng	I just don't want to be Tom's wife.
2016884	eng	I thought you might want this back.
2018876	eng	What do you want to protect us from?
2018926	eng	She was in France.
2019109	eng	Do you want to go to the gym with me?
2019129	eng	I don't want to be late for the show.
2019167	eng	I want you to take this medicine now.
2020353	eng	His career is on the line.
2021419	eng	You are persona non grata.
2025847	eng	I don't want someone else. I want you.
2025954	eng	Why wouldn't Tom want me at his party?
2026468	eng	Tom, I have someone I want you to meet.
2026489	eng	You want to get out of here, don't you?
2026564	eng	I know exactly who Tom wants me to meet.
2026871	eng	How do you want to handle this situation?
2026968	eng	We don't want to create any new problems.
2028643	eng	I want you all to be on your best behavior.
2029929	eng	Do as she says.
2029988	eng	I couldn't have done this without you.
2032000	eng	Are you sure you don't want me to come with you?
2033188	eng	I didn't want to lose Tom.
2033390	eng	I want to know what's funny.
2033550	eng	You all might want to sit down.
2033581	eng	Here's a test I want you to take.
2033681	eng	We don't want you to feel pressured.
2033688	eng	I want to take a closer look at that.
2033690	eng	I want you to come somewhere with me.
2033747	eng	That's what I want to talk to you about.
2033871	eng	Tom doesn't want people asking so many questions.
2033894	eng	I didn't know how to tell Tom I didn't want to go.
2033963	eng	You don't want to let on how smart you really are.
2034049	eng	Do you want me to say that I won't keep seeing Mary?
2035014	eng	Algorithm execution is not limited to machines. Some advances can be achieved by cooperative behavior.
2038371	eng	Owls are active at night.
2039876	eng	All I wanted was to make you happy.
2039977	eng	Your face says that you don't agree.
2040079	eng	She was almost run over by a car.
2042075	eng	The movie was a real tear-jerker.
2042248	eng	Oh, it's you. Come in.
2042369	eng	The motion was carried unanimously.
2042675	eng	I promised Tom and I really don't want to disappoint him.
2042701	eng	Are you honestly telling me you never want to get married?
2042775	eng	The only time my son talks to me is when he needs some money.
2044537	eng	Do I usually seem happy?
2044592	eng	We've never been happier.
2044728	eng	I'm so happy that you're here.
2044788	eng	Tom doesn't look happy about it.
2044816	eng	They don't look so happy, do they?
2044821	eng	Tom wasn't happy with what he saw.
2044949	eng	I should just go on to happier things, okay?
2045457	eng	I would never dream of leaving you.
2045766	eng	You have beautiful eyes.
2045832	eng	You get more beautiful every year.
2045841	eng	You really do have a beautiful smile.
2046669	eng	I'm really busy.
2046712	eng	How busy could Tom be?
2046714	eng	I told Tom I was busy.
2046795	eng	You've certainly been busy.
2046847	eng	Actually, Tom, I'm a little busy.
2046905	eng	We'll do that later when we're not so busy.
2047605	eng	I'll be more careful.
2047658	eng	Tom carefully opened the lid.
2049776	eng	Do I want to be able to continue working as a teacher?
2053820	eng	The walls of her room were covered in posters.
2055440	eng	Moncalvo is the smallest Italian city.
2055469	eng	Don't you like any Chinese food?
2055642	eng	Just being is good enough.
2056383	eng	She comes from a mixed family.
2056984	eng	Publishing poems is like throwing rose petals into the Grand Canyon and waiting for echoes.
2057103	eng	I wish to pretend to be an actor.
2057837	eng	If it doesn't happen, don't blame me.
2057838	eng	Tom still blames you for Mary's death.
2060744	eng	I guess you never learned how to do this.
2062912	eng	I must be doing something wrong.
2064692	eng	Was it something special?
2064707	eng	Something's going on here.
2064790	eng	I should have said something.
2064808	eng	Can I help you with something?
2064888	eng	There's something I need to say.
2065160	eng	Do it any way you can.
2071253	eng	The language of friendship is not words but meanings.
2071674	eng	Prove me wrong.
2074279	eng	I had to cool my heels for an hour in front of the door, waiting for his highness to leave the bathroom.
2077781	eng	This is taking forever.
2079561	eng	The horse has four feet.
2082661	eng	He came into the room with his hat and coat.
2091094	eng	No one got hurt.
2091111	eng	No one's prepared.
2091130	eng	No one would listen.
2093256	eng	Gotta go now, bye!
2094772	eng	Tom knows everybody.
2095431	eng	Can someone give me a lift?
2095588	eng	I was told that. E-mail, in particular.
2095611	eng	As earlier mentioned, I was afraid.
2096760	eng	What's the point of my knowing three foreign languages if I don't know what to say?
2097375	eng	It is not my name.
2099914	eng	This horse stands fifteen hands and weighs seventy stone.
2103110	eng	Did you sleep with her?
2107477	eng	Tom's dangerous.
2107637	eng	Tom's unhappy.
2111183	eng	Tom enlisted.
2111192	eng	Tom confessed.
2111279	eng	They're hollow.
2111405	eng	That's scary.
2111426	eng	That's ingenious.
2111439	eng	That's fascinating.
2111513	eng	Stay focused.
2111741	eng	I'm divorced.
2112225	eng	Unless we find some way to drum up more business, bankruptcy will be our only option.
2112226	eng	We put a wealth of information at your fingertips.
2117554	eng	Ben's not as young as he looks.
2118677	eng	Do you like it when I do this?
2119428	eng	Don't ever give up.
2122293	eng	There is milk in the fridge.
2123501	eng	We're trying.
2123576	eng	It's stuck.
2123585	eng	It's real.
2128978	eng	The Mediterranean diet seems to be good for our health.
2130736	eng	I have hundreds of such examples in my computer.
2130878	eng	Mary knows how to swim.
2133090	eng	He bought a new car, but we didn't know anything about that.
2134767	eng	I don't make faces at them.
2142978	eng	I forgot to sent her an email.
2144586	eng	It really is your fault.
2147800	eng	The depth of the debates has decreased, as the new forms of social media do not provide enough space for the elaboration of long arguments.
2151930	eng	We don't fight for trendy clothes, we fight for justice.
2156525	eng	You're mistaken. That's not what I said.
2158755	eng	International languages like English, Spanish, and French do not really have "countries" anymore, but people know their lands of origin.
2162929	eng	Do you want to do this now?
2163097	eng	I like the way you think.
2167953	eng	Is there a washing machine in her house?
2169663	eng	Kim arrived back home safely.
2171634	eng	The forecast calls for rain.
2175918	eng	The poor don't get richer when the rich get poorer.
2178009	eng	We made something wrong.
2179393	eng	He was distracted by the beautiful girl.
2181609	eng	I'd like a Toyota.
2186507	eng	They were both drunk.
2187626	eng	He slapped my ass.
2187681	eng	Your time is limited, so don't waste it living someone else's life. Don't be trapped by dogma - which is living with the results of other people's thinking. Don't let the noise of other's opinions drown out your own inner voice. And most important, have the courage to follow your heart and intuition.
2188430	eng	He's ruthless.
2194376	eng	I don't trust strangers.
2194955	eng	He told everybody at school.
2195219	eng	He's the bomb.
2199671	eng	He's an excellent kisser.
2199755	eng	You reek of alcohol.
2199786	eng	She's the teacher's pet.
2200250	eng	I was listening.
2201119	eng	I like coffee better than black tea.
2202650	eng	We're claustrophobic.
2202758	eng	You're diligent.
2202817	eng	We're exhausted.
2202884	eng	Tom is frantic.
2203006	eng	You're inflexible.
2203194	eng	We're pooped.
2203224	eng	Mary is pretty.
2203444	eng	Tom is thin.
2203451	eng	Tom is through.
2203563	eng	Tom is vague.
2203648	eng	Tom is dieting.
2203678	eng	Who fell?
2203713	eng	Who intervened?
2203806	eng	Tom is speaking.
2203836	eng	Tom will succeed.
2206831	eng	Throw out your weapon!
2207586	eng	It's just a stretch of sand.
2208364	eng	I'll just go alone.
2208414	eng	We'll leave you alone.
2208419	eng	I know Tom isn't alone.
2208460	eng	I need to get them alone.
2208463	eng	I'm alone in my quarters.
2208645	eng	I don't want to be alone right now.
2208729	eng	I think you should leave well enough alone.
2210529	eng	I'm not a slut!
2210573	eng	Why don't you ask Tom yourself?
2210699	eng	Why don't you give me the knife?
2210729	eng	Why don't you go out and play with your friends?
2210810	eng	Why is my sister so mean?
2213891	eng	He's a short order cook.
2214016	eng	Do what he says.
2214692	eng	I hear you have a new girlfriend.
2214697	eng	He's standing on his head.
2215028	eng	Finnish is a very interesting language.
2215622	eng	Tom will apologize.
2215649	eng	Tom will come around.
2215672	eng	Tom will find them.
2217629	eng	He tore his ligament.
2218029	eng	You're a looker.
2218057	eng	You're all done.
2218082	eng	You're an animal.
2218292	eng	You're not smiling.
2218324	eng	You're our neighbor.
2218352	eng	You're really selfish.
2218356	eng	You're right, Tom.
2221126	eng	He gave her a foot massage.
2221466	eng	God does not exist.
2230779	eng	Go that way.
2232684	eng	This road is under repair.
2233713	eng	This is nuts.
2233730	eng	This is scary.
2234097	eng	What's that for?
2234136	eng	What's their story?
2234869	eng	I'm sorry, but I already have a girlfriend.
2235227	eng	He's never hit me before.
2235599	eng	Was Tom coherent?
2235708	eng	I believe Tom.
2236266	eng	Tom felt safe.
2236775	eng	Tom is moral.
2236896	eng	Tom is uneasy.
2237099	eng	Tom kept singing.
2237255	eng	Tom looks horrible.
2237435	eng	Tom nervously entered.
2237582	eng	Tom poisoned Mary.
2237613	eng	Tom remained seated.
2237615	eng	Tom remained still.
2238510	eng	He asked her why she came so late.
2238674	eng	Tom spoke up.
2238683	eng	Tom staggered out.
2238715	eng	Tom started sobbing.
2239599	eng	The Atari 2600 was popular in the early eighties.
2239734	eng	Tom was assaulted.
2240172	eng	Tom wasn't married.
2240445	eng	Are you sure this is a good idea?
2240492	eng	Logic is the beginning of wisdom, not the end.
2240692	eng	We're staying here.
2240744	eng	We're not evacuating.
2241044	eng	We can talk.
2241090	eng	We feel terrible.
2241137	eng	We know everything.
2241166	eng	We must check.
2241413	eng	We need authorization.
2241423	eng	We need somebody.
2241538	eng	We'll be fast.
2241558	eng	We'll camp here.
2241603	eng	We'll lose everything.
2241604	eng	We'll meet later.
2241633	eng	We'll talk here.
2241686	eng	We've had meetings.
2241697	eng	We've seen nothing.
2242727	eng	You can go there, but you'll need to be careful the whole time.
2243021	eng	They all hugged.
2243069	eng	They bother me.
2243300	eng	They sat down.
2243389	eng	They were married.
2243497	eng	They were shorthanded.
2243517	eng	They weren't there.
2243528	eng	They won't understand.
2243544	eng	They'll believe anything.
2243715	eng	They've all left.
2244264	eng	I love camels.
2244962	eng	Are you registered?
2245052	eng	Can you continue?
2245187	eng	Close the shutters.
2245215	eng	Come to us.
2245649	eng	I can't leave.
2245678	eng	I despise you.
2245738	eng	I feel betrayed.
2245923	eng	I just redecorated.
2246721	eng	The boy made a paper plane.
2247443	eng	I want everything.
2247459	eng	I was away.
2247568	eng	I wear boxers.
2247634	eng	I won't run.
2247670	eng	I'll be going.
2247693	eng	I'll catch up.
2247750	eng	I'll go look.
2247774	eng	I'll keep watch.
2247834	eng	You were quite rude. That wasn't called for.
2247867	eng	I'll tell someone.
2248001	eng	I'm fully qualified.
2248208	eng	I'm paying attention.
2248296	eng	I'm very embarrassed.
2248646	eng	Is this OK?
2248692	eng	Isn't that natural?
2248746	eng	It isn't possible.
2248776	eng	It looks suspicious.
2248777	eng	It looks terrible.
2248799	eng	It was adequate.
2248936	eng	It wasn't there.
2248949	eng	It won't open.
2249118	eng	It's not ethical.
2249176	eng	It's pretty new.
2249268	eng	It's so obvious.
2249385	eng	It's your life.
2249386	eng	It's your money.
2249560	eng	Look over there.
2249582	eng	Make it simple.
2249649	eng	Nothing will happen.
2249716	eng	Now shut up.
2249970	eng	Sit right there.
2250072	eng	Take your seats.
2252613	eng	There are survivors.
2253794	eng	Try it out.
2253899	eng	This restaurant serves generous portions.
2254299	eng	Get it out of the house.
2254330	eng	We've got to leave early.
2254513	eng	Were you sleeping?
2254697	eng	Which one's yours?
2254968	eng	You deserve this.
2254998	eng	You have potential.
2255031	eng	You look determined.
2255190	eng	You seem disappointed.
2255404	eng	You've been great.
2255421	eng	You've done good.
2258198	eng	Don't punish the children.
2258804	eng	I need to rent a room.
2258920	eng	Is everything arranged for the trip?
2259082	eng	Please bathe the children.
2259239	eng	That news got around.
2259483	eng	There was a crowd of people at the entrance of the theater.
2261048	eng	What were you thinking?
2261134	eng	She's not going.
2261150	eng	Tom just watches.
2261175	eng	Can I bring Tom?
2261885	eng	Has Tom been informed?
2261905	eng	How does Tom feel?
2262027	eng	I'm not blaming Tom.
2262427	eng	Tom accepted the challenge.
2262535	eng	Tom goes to church every Sunday.

2361363	eng	I don't need to tell you again, do I?
2361367	eng	I don't plan on leaving until the day after tomorrow.
2361374	eng	I don't really feel like reading.
2361376	eng	I don't really have a family.
2361503	eng	I don't think Tom would mind.
2361649	eng	I need to change my clothes.
2361656	eng	I need to make a phone call.
2361679	eng	I really don't understand women.
2361769	eng	I want to buy a gift for Tom.
2361774	eng	I want to know if you've been talking to Tom.

2373951	eng	I just saw it for myself.
2373983	eng	I just started reading this book.
2374012	eng	I just told Tom about my promotion.
2374026	eng	I just want it.
2375905	eng	I know how hard it's been.
2376125	eng	I know that you can hear me.
2376270	eng	I know what I did was wrong.
2376597	eng	I know you recently got a new job.
2377268	eng	I learned a lot about Tom.
2377413	eng	I lent Tom a flashlight.
2378596	eng	The doors wouldn't open, so I had to get in through the trunk.
2380228	eng	I love what I do.
2380449	eng	I made you some cupcakes.
2387122	eng	I meant to talk to you about that.
2387418	eng	I nearly forgot it.
2387533	eng	I need someone I can trust.
2387540	eng	I need someone who's trustworthy.
2387549	eng	I need this job.
2388106	eng	I never get to go anywhere.
2388174	eng	I never really thought I'd get married.
2389572	eng	I opened the door and held it open for Mary.
2389873	eng	I played the trombone when I was younger.
2389875	eng	I prefer not to discuss it here.
2390750	eng	I'll pack my bag.
2390837	eng	I really have to get going.
2392857	eng	Why didn't somebody help Tom?
2395981	eng	Don't be such a jerk.
2396084	eng	I don't know why you need it.
2396152	eng	I wanted to impress you.
2397792	eng	It was very daring of you to say that.
2399370	eng	There's a delightful park in the center of town.
2400095	eng	Tom advised Mary not to go there by herself.
2400157	eng	Tom doesn't seem to be celebrating.
2400879	eng	Some people aren't practical at all.
2403385	eng	There's really no way to continue this conversation any longer.
2403537	eng	I have one green shirt.
2404168	eng	I run a motel.
2405890	eng	I said put the gun down!
2406246	eng	I see no reason to tell you anything.
2406377	eng	I should've been able to handle Tom.
2406387	eng	I should've been there sooner.
2406421	eng	I should've known something was going on.
2406493	eng	I shouldn't have brought it up.
2406598	eng	I still don't know how to thank you.
2406796	eng	I stopped asking questions.
2406881	eng	I suppose it's possible.
2406888	eng	I suppose that's one of the reasons Tom isn't here.
2406919	eng	I suppose you want me to pay for this.
2407138	eng	I suspect you're wrong.
2407191	eng	I take it you've made a decision.
2407220	eng	I teach French to college kids.
2407769	eng	I think I have a pretty good idea what Tom might do.
2407849	eng	I think I'd better head home.
2408135	eng	I think something is wrong.
2408184	eng	I think there's been a mistake.
2408264	eng	I think Tom is going to be all right.
2408343	eng	I think Tom might be drunk.
2408408	eng	I think we can do that.
2408460	eng	I think we should follow Tom.
2408507	eng	I think we're safe for a while.
2415033	eng	In archaeology, it is important to keep findings intact and undamaged.
2418616	eng	Ideally, a candidate for this job should have four years' work experience.
2419346	eng	Help is always appreciated.

2422904	eng	You are in my spot.
2423550	eng	He's always late to class.
2425828	eng	Excuse me!
2431167	eng	She acted like she didn't know anything.
2431173	eng	Not all of these decisions are welcome by all.
2431800	eng	This famous actress checked into rehab for the second time to treat her addiction.
2439767	eng	I think she's had a few Botox injections.
2442867	eng	Tom, can you come tomorrow?
2446440	eng	Did Marika like Japanese comic books?
2451103	eng	French isn't as difficult to learn as some people think.
2451120	eng	I heard Tom speak French yesterday for the first time.
2451178	eng	I've heard that French is a difficult language.
2451292	eng	Tom didn't like French class very much.
2451333	eng	If you'd prefer, we can speak French.
2451415	eng	Tom's French is better than mine.
2451545	eng	Tom speaks very good French.
2451666	eng	We all speak French.
2452019	eng	It's thirty kilometers away.
2452049	eng	Tom is aware of his shortcomings.
2452068	eng	Intuitively, the basic atomic unit of meaning is a word.
2454473	eng	He won't listen to me.
2455497	eng	I didn't mean to make him feel bad.
2455724	eng	Not only is Tursun a good coach, but he cooks for us as well.
2457350	eng	The band played a march.
2458067	eng	Tatoeba should be more important than anything else.
2458487	eng	I think you should come down here.
2458574	eng	I think you're going to do great.
2458588	eng	I think you're missing the point.
2458747	eng	This plant is indigenous to Canada.
2459481	eng	Meet me in the bar.
2464841	eng	There's a day left.
2467256	eng	Is that all your small change?
2468917	eng	I only buy super soft toilet paper.
2470115	eng	I fell asleep on the train and when I woke up, the train was dark and all the doors were locked.
2470668	eng	Good for you!
2470830	eng	The doctor gave her four stitches.
2471394	eng	She had a crush on her teacher.
2471811	eng	You don't have to get your panties in a bunch about it.
2473181	eng	I found out about it on the news.
2474296	eng	Walk three blocks and then turn right.
2474675	eng	To go on from pain to pain mystery to mystery. From stone pain to plant pain. For everything is pain. The pain of battle the fear of not being. Links of pain chain the earth to the sky the waters to the land. And worlds gallop in orbits of affliction. Thinking of surprise.
2476546	eng	Tom's name was on the list.
2476779	eng	Mary has been in a foul mood all week.
2481321	eng	This is the word to regain our dignity.
2483473	eng	Of what benefit is it for a person to be beautiful?
2486573	eng	I want milk and cookies!
2490369	eng	His parents are out of town.
2492914	eng	Have any of you ever talked to Tom?
2496188	eng	Why didn't you wake me up?
2501468	eng	I have to sell it today.
2510607	eng	The bouncers can't decide who can enter a club and who cannot.
2513105	eng	Is it good or not?
2516930	eng	He's a Frenchman.
2517250	eng	She covered me with a blanket.
2517769	eng	Tom had no idea what the woman was talking about.
2518556	eng	She wants to be popular.
2520193	eng	He took it out from under his coat.
2522620	eng	I was disappointed at how little work there was there.
2524305	eng	Your pen is bad.
2528461	eng	Today it feels like hell is freezing over, so it's probably a good idea to dress for anything.
2528534	eng	Tom is likely to pass today's exam.
2529437	eng	I'm sure we'd be able to do this if we had Tom's help.
2530154	eng	How far?
2534586	eng	I hope that doesn't happen.
2535147	eng	Tom and Mary talked about everything under the sun.
2535994	eng	Just between us, he doesn't think very deeply.
2537036	eng	You've been studying this problem for a while. What do you think the solution is?
2537046	eng	I'm not sure you'll have enough time to do everything we've asked you to do.
2537107	eng	I'm supposed to make sure Tom doesn't forget to buy the tickets.
2537309	eng	I wouldn't want you to think I wasn't happy to see you.
2537354	eng	Tom wants to ask you if you'll help him next weekend.
2537419	eng	Tom has written down a list of things we need to do.
2537524	eng	Tom won't stop you from doing what you plan to do.
2537577	eng	You've always known this would eventually happen.
2537589	eng	Tom told Mary about everything that had happened.
2537591	eng	Tom said he didn't want to buy anything for Mary.
2537697	eng	I'm sure Tom understands what we want him to do.
2537765	eng	Tom doesn't like people telling him what to do.
2537888	eng	I'm going to stay in the pool a little longer.
2537902	eng	I wonder if you really understand what I mean.
2537940	eng	Tom is thinking about what he should do next.
2538071	eng	I'm well aware of Tom's financial situation.
2538097	eng	I'm going to take Tom back to his apartment.
2538441	eng	You won't need to worry about that again.
2538648	eng	Tom has been taken to a nearby hospital.
2538812	eng	Tom wouldn't tell us what he was doing.
2538929	eng	I'm having really bad luck with my car.
2538999	eng	I want to know when Tom came to Boston.
2539197	eng	I'm not doing anything tomorrow night.
2539199	eng	I'm looking forward to tomorrow night.
2539275	eng	I was afraid you wouldn't remember me.
2539290	eng	I thought Tom might be your boyfriend.
2539323	eng	Tom wrapped a towel around his waist.
2539462	eng	I'm not discounting that possibility.
2539639	eng	Tom wanted Mary to read him a story.
2539745	eng	I'm not surprised at Tom's behavior.
2539824	eng	I wouldn't have done the same thing.
2539889	eng	I thought we were talking about Tom.
2540062	eng	I'm sure Tom will listen to reason.
2540133	eng	I'm going to get there before dark.
2540134	eng	I'm going to finish what I started.
2540272	eng	I thought we all had plans tonight.
2540377	eng	Tom refused to play poker with us.
2540387	eng	Tom is Mary's long-time boyfriend.
2541496	eng	I wish Tom were here to help us.
2541531	eng	I told you to stay away from me.
2541671	eng	Tom put his keys in his pocket.
2541676	eng	Tom owns a house near the lake.
2541717	eng	Tom did what he was told to do.
2541947	eng	I'll make all the arrangements.
2542092	eng	I didn't know Tom was Canadian.
2542096	eng	How long will the meeting last?
2542106	eng	You've said that to me before.
2542265	eng	Tom began to open the present.
2542483	eng	I'll try to keep that in mind.
2542564	eng	I wonder what that's used for.
2542763	eng	Tom watched from the doorway.
2543095	eng	I'll give you thirty dollars.
2543096	eng	I'll give you another minute.
2543099	eng	I'll explain it to you later.
2543443	eng	I've told Tom where Mary is.
2543491	eng	I'm really sorry about that.
2543610	eng	I'm better looking than you.
2543710	eng	I'd do anything to help you.
2543743	eng	I wasn't worried about that.
2543775	eng	I was going to do it myself.
2543831	eng	I thought Tom sounded angry.
2543865	eng	You're with me, aren't you?
2544026	eng	They won't risk doing that.
2544098	eng	I'm sorry about everything.
2544183	eng	I'm going to miss you, Tom.
2544248	eng	I'll see you later at home.
2544499	eng	We do everything together.
2544520	eng	Tom will be here all week.
2544553	eng	Tom pulled out his wallet.
2544626	eng	That was a disappointment.
2544649	eng	I'm taking Tom for a walk.
2544711	eng	I'm not much of an artist.
2544780	eng	I'm going to drive myself.
2545079	eng	We have thirty employees.
2545123	eng	Tom walked down the hall.
2545426	eng	I'm delighted to see you.
2545587	eng	I told you Tom was smart.
2545696	eng	We forgot all about Tom.
2545807	eng	Tom handed Mary her bag.
2545847	eng	The music was very loud.
2545876	eng	I'm unprepared for this.
2545980	eng	I'm in town on business.
2546177	eng	I was a science teacher.
2546211	eng	I thought I was too old.
2546234	eng	You're worse than I am.
2546401	eng	Tom jumped up and down.
2546404	eng	Tom is with his mother.
2546930	eng	Tom went back outside.
2547047	eng	This is a catastrophe.
2547157	eng	I'm not hungry either.
2547159	eng	I'm not going to work.
2547348	eng	I wasn't on duty then.
2547358	eng	I was surprised by it.
2547541	eng	Tom turned up the TV.
2547652	eng	Is that your bicycle?
2547874	eng	I'd never get caught.
2548021	eng	We're on a schedule.
2548071	eng	Tom signed his name.
2548216	eng	I'm prepared to die.
2548224	eng	I'm not in any pain.
2548256	eng	I'm glad you called.
2548285	eng	I'll try to do that.
2548347	eng	I'll be in my study.
2548477	eng	Where are the kids?
2548556	eng	Tom said he was OK.
2548626	eng	This is a surprise.
2548686	eng	I'm on my way home.
2549008	eng	Tom fed the sheep.
2549037	eng	It isn't a threat.
2549063	eng	I'm mad at myself.
2549382	eng	I want to change.
2549526	eng	I'll go do that.
2549658	eng	I was hammered.
2549678	eng	Tom was proud.
2549691	eng	They had guns.
2549698	eng	It was a mess.
2549726	eng	I owe you $30.
2549779	eng	I was framed.
2549800	eng	You made it.
2549940	eng	Tom entered the room without knocking.
2550697	eng	I want to give you my heart for ever.
2551649	eng	I'd say that I came on time.
2552555	eng	When can we see each other?
2561590	eng	What brings you here today?
2563144	eng	There is a howdah on the horse and a saddle on the elephant.
2563518	eng	It snowed in the morning, didn't it?
2564716	eng	He blamed it on me.
2566008	eng	What if something happened to her?
2567705	eng	Don't expect miracles.
2567711	eng	This is going to be difficult.
2568574	eng	He's a child actor.
2568604	eng	My friends call me Tom.
2569061	eng	Drink plenty of water.
2569258	eng	What do you know about Tatoeba?
2569528	eng	She just couldn't do it.
2570194	eng	It was an avoidable mistake.
2570352	eng	Come on, hurry up. You'll miss the bus.
2570803	eng	You've lost your umbrellas.
2571038	eng	He bent forward.
2571088	eng	It won't be ready.
2571533	eng	My socks are still damp.
2575708	eng	A sea of words, but only a drop of sense.

2580838	eng	A typical Bavarian breakfast consists of white sausage, wheat beer and pretzels.
2584037	eng	Don't try to do this without my help.
2584041	eng	What you said is correct.
2584057	eng	So you were never in love with me.
2586818	eng	This seems wrong.
2588701	eng	Things didn't go well.
2590838	eng	Superconducting magnets can be used for the levitation of high-speed trains.
2591379	eng	You should take your umbrella with you in case it rains.
2592719	eng	I want to be able to speak Russian fluently.
2594389	eng	She knows the way.
2595658	eng	It's not legal for people under 20 to drink in Canada.
2595686	eng	Please be careful of gales and large waves.
2609453	eng	I have no siblings.
2609473	eng	There's a yellow car in front of me.
2609486	eng	Tom was the only guy in the class.
2610188	eng	The climate here is milder than in Moscow.
2611865	eng	He has lunch.
2612034	eng	I have got a lot of CDs.
2617218	eng	Emily wants to learn Greek.
2618649	eng	I think it's time for you to leave now.
2622483	eng	I need scissors.
2626671	eng	I would've left before Tom got here if I'd known he was coming.
2626864	eng	A small boy ate a Kit-Kat.
2629418	eng	Tell me what he said.
2629419	eng	They had the majority in Parliament.

2633374	eng	This is the best tool to use.
2633388	eng	The moon is made out of cheese.
2635919	eng	I've been misunderstood.
2635921	eng	Stop calling me that.
2638755	eng	If we hurry, we might make it to the midnight showing.
2639119	eng	Moscow is the capital of Russia.
2639675	eng	Tom remained in the car while Mary went into the supermarket.
2640036	eng	Tom was standing in front of the guest room door.
2640313	eng	You've never cared about anyone but yourself.
2640391	eng	I had no idea you could speak French so well.
2640434	eng	Tom is the one who can speak French, not me.
2640492	eng	You'll feel better after you eat something.
2640814	eng	You knew about this already, didn't you?
2640838	eng	Tom told Mary that John was sick in bed.
2640845	eng	Tom said Mary wouldn't be here tomorrow.
2641302	eng	Tom got an A on his last French test.
2641312	eng	Tom doesn't appreciate what Mary did.
2641395	eng	You and Tom are good friends, right?
2641396	eng	What're you doing with those things?
2641626	eng	Tom said he needed one of us there.
2641686	eng	Tom brought his guests some drinks.
2641830	eng	Tom thinks it's a ridiculous idea.
2641872	eng	Tom is somewhere here in the park.
2642399	eng	Tom didn't know you were joking.
2642454	eng	Someone has ransacked the place.
2642566	eng	Tom was escorted from the room.
2642600	eng	Tom said you were good-looking.
2642639	eng	Tom joined Mary and the others.
2642768	eng	Everybody here knows your name.
2642867	eng	Tom shouldn't have interfered.
2642923	eng	Tom hopped in the driver seat.
2643049	eng	I didn't need to go to Boston.
2643116	eng	We've discussed this already.
2643141	eng	Tom will be here soon enough.
2643146	eng	Tom was the only one sitting.
2643381	eng	I told you Tom would be late.
2643427	eng	You said you were concerned.
2643568	eng	Tom loves to try new things.
2643642	eng	Tom closed his eyes briefly.
2643745	eng	I knew that Tom wasn't busy.
2643759	eng	Has Tom ever threatened you?
2643765	eng	Do you know that for a fact?
2643769	eng	Did Tom do well on the exam?
2643786	eng	You'd better ask Tom first.
2643856	eng	We need a little more time.
2643939	eng	Tom looks totally confused.
2643964	eng	Tom is probably frightened.
2644195	eng	Why aren't you interested?
2644362	eng	Tom looks really familiar.
2644603	eng	All of my things are gone.
2644692	eng	What have you discovered?
2644851	eng	Tom moved back to Boston.
2644910	eng	Tom hates Mary's cooking.
2644959	eng	Tom could've been killed.
2645040	eng	Let them know we're busy.
2645279	eng	Tom still isn't so busy.
2645370	eng	Tom has been exonerated.
2645414	eng	Tom asked for my number.
2645445	eng	They could be listening.
2645467	eng	Thank you for breakfast.
2645589	eng	You don't seem so busy.
2645648	eng	What're you discussing?
2645807	eng	Tom needs his medicine.
2645938	eng	Tom can't believe this.
2645990	eng	These horses are Tom's.
2646362	eng	Tom left this message.
2646375	eng	Tom isn't very bright.
2646463	eng	Tom can't accept that.
2646679	eng	You must be new here.
2646710	eng	Who were you calling?
2646855	eng	Tom stifled a scream.
2646965	eng	Tom is a good father.
2647011	eng	Tom crossed his arms.
2647098	eng	Show Tom your bruise.
2647099	eng	Show Tom the picture.
2647162	eng	How is that relevant?
2647225	eng	Are you their mother?
2647459	eng	Tom loves gardening.
2647519	eng	Tom has had his say.
2647606	eng	Thanks for the call.
2647819	eng	What did that mean?
2647825	eng	We were all scared.
2648013	eng	They were all weak.
2648058	eng	Read it to me, Tom.
2648111	eng	I'm sort of hungry.
2648434	eng	That's not my car.
2648618	eng	When did Tom die?
2648687	eng	Tom kept a diary.
2648709	eng	Tom got the idea.
2649010	eng	Is Tom for real?
2649102	eng	Tom has a plan.
2649249	eng	Ignore it.
2649554	eng	Tom manages to find time for almost anything but work.
2649562	eng	That's the first good news we've had in a long time.
2654547	eng	Establish contact with me tomorrow.
2654567	eng	I found this test difficult.
2654569	eng	I solved this problem with difficulty.
2654831	eng	She really enjoyed the pizza party at the neighbor's.
2655583	eng	Almost everything you do will seem insignificant, but it is important that you do it.
2658063	eng	There are a lot of fish in the lake.
2658110	eng	To our surprise, she went to Brazil alone.
2658512	eng	He's using you.
2659060	eng	She wrote a letter.
2659575	eng	My father and my older brother work in this factory.
2659678	eng	He works frantically to achieve his goal.
2660106	eng	I think this layout is very good.
2661871	eng	I will never tell this to anyone.
2662362	eng	Feel free to do whatever you like.
2662499	eng	I think people should work together to find reasonable solutions to their problems.
2662531	eng	Does anybody have any medical problems that we need to know about?
2662736	eng	Are there any problems we need to deal with now?
2662789	eng	Do you have a problem with what was suggested?
2662799	eng	That could be the answer to all our problems.
2662957	eng	We now have a whole new set of problems.
2663079	eng	I want to tell you about my problems.
2663260	eng	They're not the problem, we are.
2663308	eng	It's me Tom has a problem with.
2663412	eng	Tom had a problem yesterday.
2663489	eng	It's just a minor problem.
2663501	eng	There's just one problem.
2664097	eng	Where do you live these days?
2664993	eng	That's what my dad always says.
2665019	eng	This happens all the time.
2665150	eng	Tom always makes a funny face when I point the camera at him.
2665201	eng	Walking on a train platform while distracted is very dangerous.
2665613	eng	I hate myself for my mistakes.
2670839	eng	I was just trying to protect you.
2673147	eng	My mother made me cottage cheese pancakes when I was young.
2673522	eng	That's super easy.
2673674	eng	He drove onto the mine and his jeep exploded.
2674788	eng	He took care of Mary's red cow, for he knew how to tend cattle and make himself useful.
2674851	eng	It's one of Tatoeba's best kept secrets.
2674891	eng	Tom's insurance company refused to pay because they determined he was injured by the heat of the fire, but not by the fire.
2674926	eng	My camera is much better than his.
2674978	eng	Tom stutters.
2675069	eng	I'm always home on Sunday.
2678348	eng	“I can bring my laptop for you to copy it.” “Oh, don’t bother, no need to carry it around, I’d rather give you a memory stick later.”
2682842	eng	He brought up a series of issues at the meeting.
2685708	eng	I want a town free of traffic.
2685923	eng	I have the soup and your check.
2686613	eng	Mr. Shimada works at an osteopathic clinic.
2693893	eng	The cuneiform alphabet invented by the Sumerians was used by many languages in the ancient Near East.
2694813	eng	Music is the international language.
2697882	eng	This reminds me of a girl.
2700307	eng	He shaved his mustache.
2700630	eng	One in three Americans believe that the sun goes round the earth!
2700711	eng	Her parents were horrified.
2700794	eng	She knows exactly what she wants.
2703292	eng	Sometimes, it's easier to ask for forgiveness, than to ask for permission.
2705430	eng	I think that something is bothering her.
2706719	eng	What time does the train arrive?
2707857	eng	What are you doing with the rest of prepared rice?
2708019	eng	My native language is Portuguese.
2709134	eng	You're working hard today.
2711370	eng	Tom has a lot on his conscience.
2711983	eng	That's a stupid rule.
2712721	eng	Tom has a son not much older than Mary.
2712861	eng	We'll start whenever you're ready.
2712934	eng	It's time you told Tom the truth.
2713051	eng	I shouldn't have gone anywhere.
2713177	eng	I'll give Tom another chance.
2713181	eng	Do you actually believe that?
2713386	eng	You must be really proud.
2713398	eng	Tom seems a little bored.
2713685	eng	I'm not from Boston.
2713714	eng	We won't surrender.
2715891	eng	You should stay home and rest for a few days.
2716758	eng	I am going to buy a beer.
2718550	eng	You should've said yes.
2718578	eng	Maybe we should've peeled the apples before we ate them.
2720574	eng	You like an elephant.
2721179	eng	What on earth has happened?
2721420	eng	Mary will finish serving her sentence next month.
2721901	eng	I love to see him smile.
2726534	eng	For a girl of her age, Mary expresses very clever, remarkable thoughts.
2726555	eng	He probably won't approve your proposal.
2727519	eng	Ken offered Tom a gift.
2728851	eng	I like reading English literature.
2728959	eng	He lied about taking the money.
2731463	eng	They got extraordinary grades.
2731636	eng	I'll heat up the soup for you.
2731668	eng	What do you want instead?
2732455	eng	They are not being careful.
2732605	eng	Forgive me for asking this.
2733121	eng	The Elbe Philharmonic Hall is a symbol of HafenCity, a new quarter of the German city Hamburg.
2734575	eng	The cane works for training dogs, but people need instruction.
2734997	eng	I'm in none of the pictures, because I took them.
2735099	eng	Tom and Mary had an argument over a text message.
2738191	eng	Tom was arrested for drunk driving.
2738275	eng	She's an avid art collector.
2738302	eng	Tom seemed a bit surprised.
2738718	eng	I wish that I had never sent this e-mail.
2740120	eng	Do you mean you hide your beauty intentionally?
2740145	eng	Tom found dragon eggs while spelunking.
2740393	eng	I spent 3000 yen on a new CD.
2740550	eng	Don't act like a bull in a china shop.
2742732	eng	It makes me sad that you're going to leave this city.
2744018	eng	It seems I'm the only one having any fun here.
2744305	eng	What does Tom expect?
2744813	eng	I want to eat curry rice for supper tonight.
2747408	eng	A thousand years make up a millennium.
2747418	eng	Nothing could be done aside from hoping.
2747648	eng	We may not have that much time.
2747753	eng	I will not let him deceive me.
2751174	eng	You shouldn't speak with your mouth full.
2753578	eng	This is Professor Oak, the director of this experiment.
2754405	eng	She wrapped her legs around him.
2756701	eng	Now we’ll examine the code in detail, in our customary fashion.
2758078	eng	You should thank him.
2758082	eng	Karis is Austrian.
2758613	eng	It is the first time this crossed my mind.
2759044	eng	Life is a little box of surprises.
2761538	eng	The others played, but Tom just looked on.
2761612	eng	The tide is low in the morning now.
2761680	eng	Tom has very liberal views.
2761754	eng	Lock the dog in the kitchen.
2761946	eng	Things shall end up sorted out.
2762704	eng	The supply of game for London is going steadily up. Head-keeper Hudson, we believe, has been now told to receive all orders for fly-paper and for preservation of your hen-pheasant's life.
2763420	eng	If you want it, you can have it.
2764033	eng	This is a book about obesity.
2764764	eng	I'll return home tomorrow.
2764813	eng	My wife is three years younger than I am.
2767583	eng	The launch was successful. We're now leaving the solar system.
2767807	eng	I'm extremely fond of your older sister.
2768052	eng	Take a look here.
2768625	eng	He'll come soon.
2769803	eng	Not so fast, young man!
2769825	eng	Please give me a haircut.
2772410	eng	What do you think about the future?
2772537	eng	The product was not taken out of the box.
2776371	eng	Do you understand the risks?
2777044	eng	Do you go there by bus, train or the metro?
2779876	eng	The heart must be in harmony and calm; only then does it find joy.
2780567	eng	Why are you always so nice to me?
2781876	eng	My piggy bank was broken by my naughty sister.
2782419	eng	They soon became inseparable.
2783747	eng	We're having some people over.
2784506	eng	The machine needs oiling.
2786891	eng	You'll make a mistake.
2787369	eng	The bear is eating an apple.
2789174	eng	I made it for you. Do you like it?
2789351	eng	You've tried so hard to put me to shame, haven't you?
2789675	eng	I have seen all the works that are done under the sun; and behold, all is vanity and a chasing after wind.
2792262	eng	I know it's my fault.
2793019	eng	Each person must give a hand to combat the problem of poverty.
2793105	eng	Who usually sits in the dunce's seat?
2795273	eng	This speech is very important.
2796053	eng	She returned quickly.
2796712	eng	It's a bit noisy, but otherwise it's a nice apartment.
2796784	eng	Tom's part of the work isn't finished.
2796888	eng	Did you do it out of spite?
2797124	eng	I played clarinet when I was in high school.
2797740	eng	I feel like having an ice cream.
2798668	eng	I'm dying to order some desserts.
2798993	eng	She was always different from other children.

2801732	eng	Your friend is a good person.
2803555	eng	Under the conditions of y'all not being able to fight in lojban, please don't fight.
2803581	eng	As said by the Lojban Group and the law, Lojban is equal to Loglan.
2803614	eng	By what method did you learn Lojban?
2803982	eng	Children work in this textile factory in conditions close to slavery making clothes for a well-known brand.

2807974	eng	Outta my way!
2809739	eng	Great! I'll grab my stuff!
2812110	eng	There's something strange about Tom today.

3150717	eng	I'd like to buy three of these apples.
3150818	eng	Do you really want to buy all this stuff?
3150867	eng	And now, I suppose you want me to buy you a new one.
3151324	eng	Maybe they've given up.
3151344	eng	Just give us a minute.
3151369	eng	Just give it to Tom.
3151401	eng	I wonder who gave Tom that information.
3151520	eng	Give me five.
3151530	eng	Give me all your money.
3151562	eng	Give it your best shot.
3152599	eng	I find it difficult to put up with him as he's such an overbearing control freak!

3153686	eng	You're giving a speech tomorrow aren't you?
3153696	eng	Tom gave the dog a piece of meat.
3154423	eng	I have really funny friends.
3154642	eng	You need to eat something.
3154816	eng	I've eaten at this restaurant three times before.

3155772	eng	Tom put his book down.
3155887	eng	Tom insisted I put on this bulletproof vest.
3156746	eng	Will you put that thing away?
3157006	eng	Tom put his wallet back into his pocket.
3157419	eng	What's it going to take to convince you?
3157427	eng	We have to convince Tom to stay here.
3157594	eng	I don't watch the TV in the afternoon.
3158123	eng	Tom set his drink down on the counter.
3158709	eng	Why do you sound so surprised?
3158723	eng	Tom didn't get along with his neighbors.
3158787	eng	Tom was the only one who came early.
3160245	eng	Tom's mother packed the picnic basket with sandwiches.
3161787	eng	Tom tried to help Mary.
3161832	eng	Tom really needs our help.
3161928	eng	Tom is going to help you.
3161959	eng	Tom helped Mary carry water from the well.
3162192	eng	Can you help me out here?
3163002	eng	I'll open a bank account.
3163030	eng	Tom cleaned out his bank accounts and disappeared.
3164443	eng	Tom has a secret room in his house.
3166106	eng	Tom opened one of the bottles.
3168168	eng	That was one of my better ideas.
3168357	eng	Tom overheard what Mary said about him.
3168481	eng	Tell me why you were fired.
3170316	eng	I thought that he loved me.
3170525	eng	What's wrong with wearing pink?
3170594	eng	Tom pressed the green button and waited for something to happen.
3170596	eng	Tom picked out a yellow shirt for me to try on.
3170606	eng	Tom noticed a dark blue car parked outside.
3170620	eng	Tom has red hair.
3170745	eng	Does this look pink to you?
3170869	eng	I can't talk about it right now.
3170881	eng	You'll have to ask Tom.
3171182	eng	Tom told me he has a few things to take care of.
3171206	eng	Tom seems mean.
3171216	eng	Tom runs fast.
3171219	eng	Tom reads a lot.
3171285	eng	Tom isn't as strong as he used to be.
3171539	eng	Tom forgot my birthday.
3171908	eng	I try to walk three miles a day.
3171985	eng	I saw you kissing Tom.
3172164	eng	I didn't have the heart to tell Tom what had happened.
3172278	eng	Do people ever accuse you of being snobbish?
3172389	eng	Are you energetic?
3174833	eng	Tom kept silent all day long.
3175528	eng	He has many books.
3176919	eng	Did you mean that?
3177226	eng	Tom put on some music.
3177868	eng	Tom went to bed, but he didn't fall asleep.
3178318	eng	You must stay in your seat.
3178524	eng	There must be something in the box.
3181109	eng	Talk to me later.
3181494	eng	Hey, I want to talk to you.
3181496	eng	Have you talked to Tom yet?
3181581	eng	We're waiting to talk to Tom.
3181761	eng	We talked about this yesterday.
3181796	eng	Could we talk over some coffee?
3181805	eng	What did you and Tom talk about?
3181942	eng	Did you get a chance to talk to Tom?
3182092	eng	I'm going to go over there and talk to Tom.
3182139	eng	Tom didn't want to talk about what had happened.
3182164	eng	We don't have to talk about it if you don't want to.
3183358	eng	Tom wouldn't speak to us.
3183933	eng	I think Tom is shallow.
3184031	eng	I think Tom is optimistic.
3184055	eng	Tom thinks Mary is a genius.
3184375	eng	Tom is younger than you might think.
3184992	eng	Just stay where you are.
3185055	eng	Tom is going to stay here.
3185350	eng	Tom is staying at the Hilton Hotel.
3185388	eng	Tom said if I wanted to stay, I could.
3185460	eng	If I were you, I'd stay away from Tom for a while.
3185583	eng	Tom said you were sick.
3185595	eng	The smell's making me sick.
3185606	eng	Tom pretended that he was sick.
3185810	eng	Tom gets paid a lot.
3185865	eng	Can you pay attention, please?
3185898	eng	We get paid better than a lot of people do.
3186292	eng	This is for a good purpose.
3186814	eng	Tom offered a reward for the return of his lost dog.
3187521	eng	You did a really good job.
3188105	eng	I disappointed my teachers.
3199775	eng	Call me after you talk to Tom.
3199865	eng	Did I tell you that?
3199875	eng	Tom said he told you.
3199929	eng	It's too soon to tell.
3199947	eng	Tom told me what to do.
3199962	eng	Tell Tom that I'm fine.
3200034	eng	Tell me about your kids.
3200081	eng	Tom told Mary to shut up.
3200358	eng	Is that what Tom told you?
3200592	eng	What am I going to tell Tom?
3200774	eng	Just tell me when to show up.
3200956	eng	Tom said you told him to wait.
3201348	eng	Putting in place a systematic classification of our archives could be a great time saver.
3201594	eng	Why didn't you tell us about Tom?
3201615	eng	Tom told me you were on vacation.
3201852	eng	Tell me about your new girlfriend.
3201922	eng	You'd better tell me what happened.
3202151	eng	Tom only does what I tell him to do.
3202372	eng	Tom told me that he would leave soon.
3202392	eng	Tom hasn't told me when he'll return.
3202563	eng	Why didn't you tell Tom you were busy?
3203722	eng	They told me to park anywhere I wanted.
3203835	eng	Tom told me to take good care of myself.
3203865	eng	Someone needs to tell Tom what happened.
3204283	eng	Tom probably could've told us how to do it.
3204552	eng	Tom couldn't tell time until he was thirteen.
3204585	eng	Everything I've told you may not be accurate.
3204674	eng	When Tom left, I told him he'd be back someday.
3204697	eng	It's the most important of all the elements for public health and medicine.
3204771	eng	Tom didn't tell the stranger who he really was.
3204801	eng	Did Tom tell you about what he saw on the news?
3204808	eng	Are you ever going to tell me how you did that?
3207340	eng	Tom was struck off the medical register for inappropriate conduct with a patient.
3212895	eng	Is it fine if I explain in English? Anyone who wouldn't be comfortable with English, please raise your hand.
3213750	eng	He wooed them with promises of higher wages.
3214115	eng	We sell a wide range of products.
3219101	eng	The furigana is automatically generated.
3221381	eng	I never thought they'd be this stupid.
3221527	eng	You are the very person I need.
3222948	eng	Tom tried to sit up.
3223036	eng	Tom and Mary sat in silence.
3223052	eng	Tom is sitting on the ground.
3226253	eng	What will happen to her if her father is taken away?
3226426	eng	I only know how to love, suffer and sing.
3231247	eng	My life is ruined.
3231262	eng	You could've ruined everything.
3231270	eng	You had to ruin the moment, didn't you?
3232385	eng	I ate too much last night.
3236041	eng	Now, it's my turn to laugh.
3236764	eng	I need to know that you're doing what we asked you to do.
3238891	eng	We now believe this drug is unsafe for children.
3245645	eng	The vegetation and the murmuring water calm my ardent mind. A wind turbine rotates behind the trees.
3248554	eng	It sounded too good to be true.
3249373	eng	Sometimes he reads detective stories.
3250927	eng	"I want something to happen." "Like what?" "I don't know."
3251389	eng	I'm a freelance journalist.
3251398	eng	Marie was short of ideas.

3260196	eng	When you hear two rings on the phone, that will be the signal that I'm leaving.
3269356	eng	He was finally arrested.
3271475	eng	Why is she sulking?
3272041	eng	They were disappointed.
3272264	eng	These chairs are taken.
3272385	eng	The file must be ready for tomorrow.
3272579	eng	She was in agony.
3272608	eng	She sorted the files in alphabetical order.
3272646	eng	She isn't the best informed to talk about it.
3272648	eng	She is worried for her future.
3272907	eng	It's weeks since I've seen Pierre.
3272982	eng	It's been a year since the French and the Dutch said "No!"
3273308	eng	I hope to pass my exams.
3273755	eng	Do you think it's normal to talk like that?
3274501	eng	I don't think there's anyone who hates Tom.
3280089	eng	Is there anything in particular you'd like me to say?
3281705	eng	Let's not waste time arguing about it.
3282734	eng	I heard him play the piano only once.
3283433	eng	I want you to tell me the truth about Tom.
3284090	eng	He looked at her eagerly.
3287156	eng	There isn't anything else I can do.
3287170	eng	I still have nothing to talk about.
3287172	eng	Do you want to see something funny?
3287213	eng	Would this be worth something to you?
3287268	eng	Can I ask you something very personal?
3287271	eng	Why isn't Tom doing something about it?
3287285	eng	There's nothing for you to worry about.
3289248	eng	I don't want to rehash all that stuff from the past.
3289648	eng	I should have done it by myself.
3299748	eng	I want you to listen to what I have to say.
3302821	eng	I'm terribly sorry for being late.
3303908	eng	You should go home. It's late and you're drunk.
3303984	eng	Mary was a tall slender young woman with dark hair.
3307293	eng	I pretended that I didn't care.
3308349	eng	Tom saw a picture of Mary hanging on the wall.
3310021	eng	We've brought you a surprise.
3310025	eng	We've got to warn Tom somehow.
3310817	eng	We're going to get you home.
3310886	eng	We're not going to do that.
3310895	eng	We're not doing anything you wouldn't approve of.
3310933	eng	We're looking forward to seeing you.
3311008	eng	We're getting off at the next station.
3311056	eng	We're getting married in three months.
3311142	eng	We're going out of business.
3311889	eng	He was bare-chested and barefoot.
3312226	eng	We'll take care of everything.
3312326	eng	We have to get out of here tonight.
3312876	eng	We look out for each other.
3312918	eng	We should wait at least thirty minutes.
3313009	eng	We need to take Tom home.
3313031	eng	We used to live here.
3314138	eng	If you're not too busy, could you help me for just a minute?
3314404	eng	You're at home.
3314970	eng	I'm not a big letter writer.
3314980	eng	Congratulations on your big victory.
3315076	eng	Tom makes big money.
3315155	eng	You were all a big help.
3315215	eng	It's not that big a deal.
3316604	eng	We keep things like that in a locked room in the basement.
3316610	eng	Tom used to lock himself in the basement for hours.
3318905	eng	The fans cheered for their team.
3318998	eng	I don't have the luxury of being generous.
3325414	eng	Tom was quite courageous.
3326660	eng	Tom made a bet.
3327499	eng	Can I see your hands?
3327630	eng	Luckily nobody was badly hurt when the truck ran into the school building.
3328123	eng	Can I get a copy of that?
3328160	eng	Can you come back later?
3328183	eng	Can I take a rain check?
3328458	eng	Can I get back to you, Tom?
3329459	eng	I speak with my mother every day.
3329630	eng	Can you just shut up, please?
3329768	eng	Can I give you some unsolicited advice?
3329956	eng	I wish Tom were here with us.
3330007	eng	I have no reason to lie to Tom.
3330096	eng	I'm not sure if I'm going to be able to be there on time.
3330217	eng	I'll send Tom a postcard.
3330375	eng	I showed Tom how to tie some knots.
3330387	eng	I didn't say you were going to enjoy it.
3330417	eng	I need to find out who he is.
3330564	eng	I can't think of anything I'd rather do.
3330647	eng	I'm not biased.
3330905	eng	You're a crazy woman.
3330942	eng	You've got to do this.
3331033	eng	You came in late.
3331982	eng	About how much would it cost to have this chair repaired?
3333879	eng	They tied me up.
3333948	eng	Has Tom changed his mind?
3333978	eng	Are you going to do it?
3339978	eng	Let's unearth the garlic.
3341726	eng	I had gone there.
3342806	eng	You'll soon find out.
3342957	eng	Everything must be in perfect order for the wedding.
3343855	eng	No one is going to know.
3346227	eng	I'm going to the beach. What about you?
3347341	eng	You got here too early.
3348041	eng	You know Tom can't win.
3348220	eng	I swear, I saw an alien!
3349326	eng	This translation is better than that one.
3350137	eng	Do you think Tom is still up?
3351590	eng	The cost of building the bridge blew out considerably.
3353813	eng	First the immigrants, next you. Our solidarity - the answer to social cannibalism.
3356278	eng	You look exactly the same as you did the last time I saw you.
3356323	eng	You may have been right.
3356325	eng	You saw the whole thing, right?
3356334	eng	You need to take these pills.
3360286	eng	You don't know me very well.
3360539	eng	Tom needs a coat.
3360618	eng	Tom likes running.
3360836	eng	Brian's all muddy. He played football.
3364260	eng	He was nicknamed "The Potato King."
3364596	eng	Why would Tom lie?
3365645	eng	Come home with me.
3370024	eng	How could you make such a mistake?
3372093	eng	Tom always keeps Mary's picture in his wallet.
3373009	eng	You don't know all the facts.
3373322	eng	What is your nickname?
3374735	eng	You're going to lose.
3378092	eng	I ate apples.
3378273	eng	He is in the library.
3378634	eng	I find his words strange, do you?
3378915	eng	That's not very far, is it?
3381358	eng	Had he not promised that he would return?
3382662	eng	That's so not cool.
3382757	eng	Pack and get dressed before your parents hear us.
3385085	eng	Have I changed that much?
3385532	eng	Music is everything.
3385838	eng	Tom is very energetic.
3385876	eng	Prague is one of Eastern Europe's most famous cities.
3387096	eng	That was one of the most difficult things I've ever done.

3392332	eng	Boston is overrated.
3392633	eng	Let's leave before Tom gets here.
3392924	eng	Were you careful?
3393001	eng	Is there any food?
3393020	eng	Did you feel that?
3393041	eng	The bus was almost empty.
3394452	eng	I got here about the same time as Tom.
3395506	eng	Can't you understand French?
3395883	eng	What exactly did you do?
3396671	eng	I haven't changed.
3396677	eng	You're not totally blameless.
3396792	eng	Aren't you guys coming?
3399651	eng	I'll treat you like an adult when you start acting like one.
3399653	eng	We don't live in a perfect world.
3402133	eng	The students all laughed.
3402302	eng	Why did Tom call you?
3402316	eng	You don't think you can win, do you?
3402498	eng	This isn't over yet.
3403239	eng	This could take weeks.
3403347	eng	You can take as much as you want.
3405156	eng	Tom needs an umbrella.
3405395	eng	Tom says he needs it today.
3405462	eng	Three hours should be enough time.
3405468	eng	Tom is having a hard time.
3408699	eng	Tom isn't part of this.

3453974	eng	The idea that God is an oversized white male with a flowing beard who sits in the sky and tallies the fall of every sparrow is ludicrous. But if by 'God' one means the set of physical laws that govern the universe, then clearly there is such a God.

3462094	eng	The problem with fundamentalists insisting on a literal interpretation of the Bible is that the meaning of words change. A prime example is 'Spare the rod, spoil the child'. A rod was a stick used by shepherds to guide their sheep to go in the desired direction. Shepherds did not use it to beat their sheep. The proper translation of the saying is 'Give your child guidance, or they will go astray.' It does not mean 'Beat the shit out of your child or he will become rotten', as many fundamentalist parents seem to believe.

3523576	eng	For Norwegians, it is normally not difficult to understand what a Swede is saying.

3560593	eng	Music is the divine way to tell beautiful, poetic things to the heart.
3560646	eng	When you stay too long in the same place, things and people go to pot on you. They rot and start stinking for your special benefit.
3561300	eng	Do you mind if I leave?
3561523	eng	Music is one of those things that make us feel a little less alone in the world.
3562538	eng	I'd prefer that we not discuss this here.
3562582	eng	How long do you think it'll take to finish the project?

3591344	eng	That's what I thought you meant.

3618824	eng	I'm sure Tom will be here.
3618854	eng	I've got a job to do here.
3618961	eng	Tom has done a lot more for me than you have.
3618978	eng	I'm going to be the new sheriff.
3619198	eng	Tom looked over to his shoulder to see if anyone was following him.
3619200	eng	Tom thinks that I'm in love with him.

3721958	eng	One of Tom's complaints is the food.
3722056	eng	I know how overwhelming it can be.
3722223	eng	The bed is unmade.
3722237	eng	We took a ride.
3722303	eng	That'll cost you your life.
3722316	eng	I've just wasted three years of my life.
3722440	eng	I can make a call if you like.

3722757	eng	That may mean nothing to you, but it means a lot to me.
3722807	eng	Everybody yells at me.

3728134	eng	There's something we have to get straight.
3728272	eng	I don't know how they're going to avoid it.
3728308	eng	You can take it or leave it.
3728403	eng	You would have gotten away with it if Tom hadn't seen you do it.
3728441	eng	Tom flipped the coin in the air and then caught it.
3728488	eng	It's going to have to wait.
3728644	eng	Tom is a worthy opponent.
3728772	eng	Gentlemen, I'd like to propose a toast.
3728806	eng	Tom tried to find out what he was up against.
3728815	eng	You must gain Tom's trust first.
3729151	eng	I've instructed Tom to help you.

3730068	eng	Tom said he's trying to hide Mary.
3730241	eng	I'm not in the mood to go to a party.
3730250	eng	That's a funny thing about people like you, you don't want to get your hands dirty.

3730276	eng	My parents are crazy.
3730340	eng	Do you mind if I get started?
3730369	eng	How do I know you'll keep your word?
3730380	eng	How lucky can one guy be?
3730491	eng	Why would anyone go to all this trouble?

3730745	eng	Can I tell them you'll be visiting?
3730936	eng	How're you going to stop me, Tom?
3730956	eng	Why do you suppose that was, Tom?
3731024	eng	What kind of deal did you strike with Tom?
3731211	eng	When's this supposed to happen?
3731360	eng	I hope you have a wonderful evening.
3731379	eng	It depends on what you mean.
3731727	eng	But why is it all so secret?
3731842	eng	It really doesn't affect you, does it?
3731943	eng	Is that bothering you?
3732238	eng	Tom seemed to be frantic.
3732340	eng	Your door was unlocked.
3732347	eng	Tom might not do what you asked.
3732353	eng	I was startled.
3732567	eng	Tom got here earlier than Mary did.
3732590	eng	I helped Tom the best I could.
3732931	eng	Tom told me that he would like to buy a new bicycle.
3732949	eng	It doesn't cost money to smile.
3733043	eng	This is all a mystery to me.
3733187	eng	Tom might've eaten on his way home.
3733560	eng	Let me concentrate.
3733567	eng	Tom isn't very polite.
3733657	eng	The lights are now off.
3733760	eng	Tom nodded without saying anything.
3733841	eng	Let that be a warning.
3733842	eng	Tom was with me all morning.
3733979	eng	Tom realized that he was wrong.
3734053	eng	Tom says he wants to learn French.
3734249	eng	This is a good place to park.
3734420	eng	I want to scream.
3734454	eng	Tom knew Mary didn't like him.
3734513	eng	I thought you said you could swim.
3734592	eng	I still think we should've gone to Boston with Tom.
3734628	eng	That used to belong to Tom.
3734837	eng	Tom never expected that Mary would fall in love with John.
3734864	eng	It might be a long time before you see me again.
3735165	eng	I don't know why I remember, but I do.
3735179	eng	Tom wasn't sure what he was supposed to do.
3735187	eng	I don't know what you expect me to do.
3735211	eng	I don't know what else you expect us to do.
3735299	eng	I've done so.
3735399	eng	I'm afraid you're going to have to do this without any help.
3735431	eng	Tom looked into the car.
3735485	eng	Tom left in early October.
3735494	eng	I think you might need to study a little harder.
3735532	eng	Tom is a violin teacher.
3735776	eng	I'm sick and tired of being the one who always washes the dishes.
3735837	eng	Tom couldn't hide his feelings.
3735980	eng	Tom searched the kitchen drawers.
3736625	eng	I don't know how many years ago that bridge was built.
3736811	eng	I still need to get a haircut.
3736845	eng	I don't know the person you're talking about.
3737063	eng	It's too early to know.
3737344	eng	I hope you recover quickly.
3737650	eng	Should I make some tea?
3737821	eng	What did Tom call me?
3737872	eng	How did you know I wanted to be alone?
3738088	eng	Is Tom still sick?
3738297	eng	Shouldn't we slow down?
3738345	eng	Who did that belong to?
3738397	eng	Remember when we were little and played together?
3738449	eng	Who wrote these messages?
3738558	eng	Do you think Tom would want to go with us?
3738650	eng	Didn't I tell you not to do that?
3738695	eng	You're in third grade, right?
3738770	eng	Shouldn't we ask Tom first?
3738884	eng	How much do I have to pay?
3738902	eng	Why is it important to save money?
3744060	eng	They're Polish.
3746387	eng	I like cooking and reading.
3748198	eng	I don't know where she went.
3748310	eng	We translated the novel from Japanese to English.
3748424	eng	Why don't you try this? It's delicious, you know!
3753794	eng	I'd like to confirm my ticket.
3754633	eng	Little Kay is really with the Snow Queen, but he finds everything there so much to his taste and his liking, that he believes it is the finest place in the world; but this is because he has a piece of broken glass in his heart, and a little piece of glass in his eye. These must be taken out, or he will never be a human being again, and the Snow Queen will retain her power over him.
3754750	eng	Above all, beware of the cat.
3757247	eng	Years passed, till Vasilissa grew up and became of an age when it is good to marry. All the young men in the village, high and low, rich and poor, asked for her hand, while not one of them stopped even to look at the stepmother's two daughters, so ill-favored were they.
3758848	eng	And that's a welcoming sentence, so to speak.
3762026	eng	I didn't think you'd be interested.
3763340	eng	What or who is at fault?
3763429	eng	He tends to forget his umbrella on the train.
3766216	eng	How many people do you see?
3767475	eng	The speaker took every opportunity he could to big-note himself.
3767485	eng	You're no better than me.
3773905	eng	A dog puts its tail between its legs and cowers when it's frightened.
3776667	eng	You don't need to get all dressed up. It's an informal event.
3777863	eng	I think that we will manage to succeed.
3777872	eng	It's raining today; so where is my umbrella?
3780412	eng	I've never seen him laugh.
3784591	eng	I pressed B to build up speed, I jumped and fell into the pit.
3791358	eng	Mary and Kate have been friends since high school.
3791491	eng	She published her article on common misconceptions to her personal blog.
3791771	eng	He is a stranger.
3804672	eng	She was good-hearted.
3812739	eng	She won't come today.
3815003	eng	Tom wants to know if you have heard Marie's news.
3818079	eng	Was someone helping you?
3818207	eng	Maybe I should join you.
3818272	eng	I'm always happy to see you.
3818365	eng	We've lived in this house for three years.
3818435	eng	I try not to worry.
3818447	eng	It's not yet working.
3818458	eng	Are you going back to work?
3818481	eng	Tom is sometimes absent from work.
3818576	eng	Are you doing well?
3818579	eng	Are you paid well?
3818930	eng	I'm fairly certain Tom doesn't believe us.
3818983	eng	Don't be so unkind.
3819016	eng	This isn't my umbrella.
3819061	eng	Tom was playing the trumpet.
3819064	eng	Do you think it's true?
3819140	eng	I feel very sleepy, too.
3819206	eng	Can't you wait until tomorrow?
3819395	eng	You need to get in touch with Tom.
3819406	eng	I spent the weekend with Tom.
3819487	eng	Tom and Mary look happy together.
3819529	eng	What's your schedule today?
3819700	eng	I haven't put new strings on my guitar in a long time.
3819774	eng	Does anyone here know how to do this?
3820122	eng	Why do you think that I would do something like that?
3820171	eng	No one has ever complained about that.
3820180	eng	Tom always does that.
3820191	eng	It may not come to that.
3820436	eng	It was a pleasant surprise.
3820454	eng	I love sunflowers.
3820525	eng	Shouldn't you be studying?
3820533	eng	Do you think I'm stubborn?
3820583	eng	Tom wondered when the snow would stop.
3820589	eng	My car was stolen.
3820591	eng	My microscope was stolen.
3820634	eng	Tom knew he had no time to spare.
3820940	eng	I really hated you when we were both in high school.
3821020	eng	Tom quickly made himself a sandwich.
3821065	eng	I hope it's safe.
3821449	eng	That doesn't sound very polite.
3821527	eng	I took the photo.
3821640	eng	How much are we going to get paid?
3821693	eng	I could've helped you out.
3821814	eng	This list is not official.
3821934	eng	I only have American coins in my pocket right now.
3821950	eng	Let's not talk about that now.
3822001	eng	Tom wondered whether he should let Mary go or not.
3822024	eng	What'll you do tomorrow night?
3822055	eng	Tom didn't go to sleep till 2:30 last night.
3822085	eng	I didn't realize you lived in this neighborhood.
3822316	eng	I'm sure I can persuade Tom to donate some money.
3822442	eng	Did anybody leave me a message?
3822774	eng	I've written to Tom about Mary.
3822788	eng	Tom couldn't decide what he should buy for Mary.
3822903	eng	We've just finished lunch.
3823023	eng	What does it sound like?
3823052	eng	I didn't realize you didn't have a driver's license.
3823305	eng	You should be in jail.
3823309	eng	Are you sure you saw it?
3823348	eng	How's that different from the way we've been doing it?
3823735	eng	I'm beginning to lose hope.
3823884	eng	When's Tom going to get here?
3823945	eng	We can't do that here.
3824028	eng	You were very helpful.
3824048	eng	This time, I can't help.
3824151	eng	We worked hard.
3824186	eng	You have to be prepared for whatever happens.
3824187	eng	It still happens.
3824218	eng	Tom went to tell the others what has happened.
3824227	eng	Who knows what'll happen?
3824319	eng	Why are you grinning?
3824446	eng	You seem to be out of gas.
3824452	eng	Tom is a gangster.
3824486	eng	What's Tom running from?
3824496	eng	Why can't we be friends?
3824511	eng	Tom is one of my good friends.
3824626	eng	It's all paid for.
3824646	eng	We want healthier food.
3824654	eng	I dreamed I was flying.
3824727	eng	It was totally my fault.
3824748	eng	Do you think I look fat?
3824811	eng	What do you want me to explain?
3824877	eng	Did you understand everything?
3825015	eng	Why are you giving up so easily?
3825039	eng	My throat's a little dry.
3825048	eng	I never use illegal drugs.
3825086	eng	I'd better write that down.
3825200	eng	Did you really think that was what Tom was planning to do?
3825209	eng	Did you really think that was what Tom wanted to do?
3825332	eng	I was very disappointed.
3825354	eng	I know it'll be difficult.
3825497	eng	I thought it was cute.
3825773	eng	Do you like cheese?
3825823	eng	I was appointed chairman.
3826156	eng	Tom probably thought I liked Boston.
3826221	eng	Tom rides a bicycle.
3826359	eng	Where will the picnic be?
3826451	eng	I never thought Tom would run away.
3826502	eng	Tom applied for asylum.
3826656	eng	I haven't heard from anyone.
3826702	eng	I won't be coming to school anymore.
3826930	eng	I'd really like to go swimming this afternoon.
3828822	eng	Tom will be here before 2:30.
3831090	eng	Tom would love to see this.
3831431	eng	Your mind doesn't seem to be on your work.
3831448	eng	Your hair looks great.
3832036	eng	My client has been charged with murder.
3836500	eng	Tom was shocked by the news that his father had had a heart attack.
3843605	eng	Please make sure to air my room while I'm out.
3844006	eng	Aristotle thought women were of weak nature and easily overtaken by their emotions.
3856330	eng	The suits in a standard deck of cards are clubs, diamonds, hearts and spades.
3856333	eng	They have a very welcoming smile.
3856494	eng	Why are you so smart?
3856825	eng	We despise you for dropping bombs on defenseless people.
3857234	eng	Many people buy things they don't really need on credit, without giving any thought to the fact that they'll have to pay it off one day.
3859777	eng	King John murdered most of his rivals before they could strike.
3864993	eng	We have finished.
3865062	eng	The teacher's method of teaching is so outmoded.
3867693	eng	What kind of parent envies his child?
3871214	eng	People born in February get to spend a higher percentage of the month celebrating their birthdays than those born in other months.
3871236	eng	Do you want to spend the rest of your life with him?
3871266	eng	Do you want to walk to the station with me?
3871320	eng	Do you want to go out for coffee?
3877404	eng	I sensed Tom's hesitation to tell all the truth.
3879614	eng	It's my duty to talk to you.
3879678	eng	Give me one good reason to stay.
3879679	eng	That man is still interested in you.
3879954	eng	It's hard to think of life as easy, but it's easy to think of life as hard.
3881522	eng	You can't keep it from me forever.
3884033	eng	You have certainly heard the news.
3884564	eng	Once upon a time there was a peasant whose wife died, leaving him with two children—twins—a boy and a girl.
3884623	eng	She gave the boy a sieve in which to carry water from the well.
3890992	eng	Where shall we go now?
3896754	eng	There are rumors that their marriage is in trouble.
3898469	eng	Once again, sorry.
3899430	eng	Which anti depressant would you recommend for someone who can not take hormones?
3902003	eng	The residents of the town formed a militia led by Tom.
3902144	eng	The vampire's wounds healed instantly.
3902973	eng	Something was wrong with them.
3903024	eng	Why do I have to work with her?
3903066	eng	I'd like a word with her.
3903092	eng	I was with her this afternoon.
3903497	eng	I'm riding with them.
3903552	eng	Is there a problem with them?
3903621	eng	Let me have a minute with him.
3903902	eng	I'm furious with them.
3904290	eng	They watched him carefully.
3904335	eng	That was him.
3904511	eng	We don't want them to leave.
3904773	eng	I want her on the phone.
3904814	eng	I want him beaten up.
3904843	eng	I have to wake them up soon.
3904856	eng	Let's go wake him up.
3904886	eng	I have to visit her.
3904888	eng	I'm going to visit him.
3904998	eng	I never should've trusted her.
3905248	eng	Have you told her already?
3905463	eng	I told him to stay indoors.
3905568	eng	I told her not to drive my car.
3905722	eng	I told him a few jokes.
3905819	eng	I can't get through to him.
3905986	eng	Tom is talking to us.
3906227	eng	We just need to talk to them.
3906398	eng	Do you want to talk to him?
3906503	eng	I'll only talk to her.
3906536	eng	We'll talk to them.
3906630	eng	Let me just go talk to them.
3907013	eng	I want you to take me to them.
3907022	eng	It doesn't matter to them.
3907232	eng	I'll mention it to her.
3907306	eng	Let me explain it to them.
3907327	eng	Say hello to them for me.
3907336	eng	Who cares what happens to them?
3907450	eng	I'm engaged to him.
3907603	eng	Throw the ball to them.
3907614	eng	No one pays attention to her.
3907628	eng	You've got to apologize to them.
3907645	eng	You should apologize to him.
3907937	eng	Tell them to leave.
3908151	eng	Tell her I don't want to go.
3908228	eng	Why couldn't you tell her?
3908282	eng	Why did you tell me first?
3908295	eng	What else did you tell him?
3908406	eng	I have something to tell her.
3908551	eng	Are you going to tell them?
3908636	eng	I didn't tell them to say that.
3908686	eng	Don't tell them about this.
3908943	eng	Can I tell her about this?
3908996	eng	You can tell her.
3909003	eng	You can tell him what you want.
3909215	eng	What if the problem isn't them?
3909263	eng	That surprised them.
3909359	eng	Do you want to stop him?
3909394	eng	I've got to stop them.
3909441	eng	We'll stop her.
3909602	eng	I sent her a note.
3909672	eng	Have you seen her lately?
3909743	eng	I haven't seen him in weeks.
3909845	eng	Have you guys seen them?
3909985	eng	I want to see you in an hour.
3910401	eng	Please let me go and see her.
3910590	eng	I saw them just this morning.
3910604	eng	I saw her in the parking lot.
3910611	eng	I saw him get hit by a car.
3910952	eng	Why are you protecting us?
3911007	eng	I can protect him.
3911033	eng	Someone tried to poison us.
3911052	eng	I'm going to pick him up.
3911233	eng	It's only her.
3911998	eng	I've misjudged them.
3912055	eng	It happened before I met him.
3912076	eng	I met him only once.
3912147	eng	I finally met him today.
3912152	eng	Have any of you ever met them?
3912157	eng	I've never even met her.
3912282	eng	When do I get to meet him?
3912422	eng	I wish I hadn't married him.
3912446	eng	Why didn't you make us stop?
3912553	eng	That made us uncomfortable.
3912641	eng	We all loved her.
3912713	eng	We're trying to locate him.
3912755	eng	I kind of liked you.
3912797	eng	Would you like us to help you?
3912827	eng	I was like her once.
3912946	eng	I really like him a lot.
3913000	eng	That looks like her.
3913030	eng	You sounded just like her.
3913102	eng	You can't help but like them.
3913181	eng	Let him leave.
3913230	eng	Let him do that for you.
3913324	eng	I need to let her know.
3913406	eng	I won't let her die.
3914113	eng	You killed her.
3914211	eng	Who tried to kill him?
3914245	eng	We can't let them kill her.
3914305	eng	Keep them inside.
3914374	eng	I didn't invite you.
3914522	eng	I wanted to hurt him.
3914626	eng	Maybe I hurt them.
3914670	eng	Who hit him?
3914741	eng	Who'd want to hire her?
3914824	eng	We've been helping them.
3914863	eng	Who helped you?
3914910	eng	I helped him clear the table.
3914992	eng	Why would you want to help him?
3915059	eng	You're supposed to help him.
3915444	eng	Do you think we can help him?
3915950	eng	I want to give her this.
3915953	eng	I ought to give them a call.
3915960	eng	We have to give them a chance.
3916115	eng	Get them over here right away.
3916124	eng	Get him out of here.
3916294	eng	I can't get them out of my mind.
3916504	eng	I gave her everything.
3916556	eng	I stole this from him.
3916779	eng	Did you get an answer from him?
3916815	eng	Show us where you found him.
3916835	eng	They found her.
3916843	eng	I thought Tom found them.
3916984	eng	It's been a bad week for them.
3917014	eng	We're waiting for them to leave.
3917018	eng	I don't like waiting for you.
3917040	eng	I waited for them.
3917134	eng	I voted for him.
3917240	eng	Don't feel too sorry for them.
3917341	eng	Pray for her.
3917550	eng	We'll help you look for her.
3917588	eng	This sounds like a job for him.
3917938	eng	You really fooled him.
3917959	eng	We followed them.
3918018	eng	I just fired them.
3918074	eng	I'll fire them.
3918372	eng	How can I find her?
3918398	eng	I have to go find her.
3918493	eng	They executed him.
3918501	eng	Everyone laughed except us.
3918670	eng	I can't control them.
3918780	eng	They caught him.
3918818	eng	There's no way I can catch them.
3918850	eng	I'm calling them back.
3919217	eng	Can you bring her back?
3919243	eng	They'll bring her.
3919266	eng	Nothing bothers them.
3919307	eng	We're not blaming them.
3919320	eng	Why blame them?

3919380	eng	Nobody believed them.
3919385	eng	I never said I believed him.

3920038	eng	What do you want me to ask them?
3920100	eng	I can't ask him to quit.
3920130	eng	Maybe you should ask them.
3920141	eng	Let's ask her something else.
3920187	eng	Why didn't you just ask him?
3920188	eng	Why didn't you just ask her?
3920247	eng	You can ask them yourself.
3920277	eng	We arrested them.
3920284	eng	They've arrested her.

4015501	eng	How did you know I'd be here?
4015553	eng	I think that would be extremely helpful.
4015615	eng	Maybe Tom doesn't care about what happens.
4015666	eng	Do you still have a gun?
4015743	eng	Do you have a magnifying glass?
4015772	eng	Come on, let's have some fun.
4015779	eng	This really isn't funny.
4015839	eng	What's it we're waiting for?

4050492	eng	Tom couldn't believe that Mary didn't want to go to the dance with him.

4512756	eng	I bet her boobs are fake.
4513734	eng	She wanted her children back.
4513787	eng	She found her sister sprawled unconscious on the sidewalk.
4514801	eng	The software has been updated.
4515620	eng	She always wanted love.
4518343	eng	The Party said: "It's necessary!" — The Komsomol answered: "Will do!"
4519859	eng	She kept that secret from nearly everyone.
4524035	eng	Mary is very good at matching people.
4529147	eng	Tom doesn't have any friends here in Boston.
4529268	eng	Tom will make an announcement at 2:30.
4529282	eng	That's really quite an accomplishment.
4529403	eng	That seems a reasonable assumption.
4529409	eng	Mr. Jackson is a very good teacher.
4529521	eng	What exactly did you anticipate?
4529540	eng	Tom never answered the question.
4529807	eng	They're going to arrest you.
4529950	eng	Tom had a brilliant idea.
4538722	eng	I'm sorry I'm dressed like this.
4539197	eng	We know you're the one who broke the window.
4539233	eng	A man who is poor, but independent of other people, is only dominated by his needs. A man who is rich, but dependent, is subordinate to another person, or to several.
4543299	eng	She wanted him to live with her in Arkhangelsk.
4558278	eng	That game was rigged.
4558936	eng	The scholarship made it possible for me to continue my studies.
4564027	eng	I'm not a big fan of these sorts of things.
4575161	eng	In the absence of justice, what is sovereignty but organized robbery?
4587256	eng	The filly was named "Comet" because she was so fast.
4588230	eng	Mary was an exotic Middle Eastern beauty.
4597404	eng	The birds were not shy, but let the girls take them in their hands, and stroke their gold and silver feathers.
4597435	eng	It is a well-known fact that a bad woman seldom becomes better as she grows older.
4609116	eng	We don't care what they say.
4625104	eng	Living in poverty is some women's fantasy. They think it's somewhat romantic.
4626435	eng	Arrest the police!
4627352	eng	Why am I so nervous?
4629624	eng	Tom pushed Mary too hard.
4629645	eng	Mary turned to prostitution.
4629747	eng	Tom agreed to hand over his gun to the police.
4630128	eng	Tom grew into a handsome teenager.
4630166	eng	Tom was making about a million dollars a year.
4630310	eng	Tom was a greedy man.
4630630	eng	Tom headed to work.
4632187	eng	Tom doesn't have any friends who like camping.
4632197	eng	They're studying to get into college.
4633518	eng	A bunch of niggers passed your mother round for a two day's crust of bread.
4635209	eng	"Doesn't that smell fantastic?" "Yeah!"
4642907	eng	Today's meeting has been cancelled.
4645003	eng	Some women don't prefer information, which they may think is just boring, and do prefer to rely on intuition, in which they may not be proficient.
4646726	eng	Is there any doctor among us?
4650860	eng	I like yellow.
4656804	eng	They tell me you're a real expert!
4660419	eng	This Russian man has a large mustache.
4662743	eng	The last time I saw Tom he was with an attractive young woman.
4662783	eng	We would still be open if we had anything to left to sell.
4662820	eng	The police think that Tom was the one who poisoned Mary.
4662913	eng	Do you think you could persuade Tom to join our team?
4663072	eng	The only foreign language I can speak is French.
4663084	eng	I guess everybody thinks that's how it happened.
4663086	eng	I could no longer pretend that I wasn't in pain.
4663147	eng	When I tripped, I had trouble getting back up.
4663373	eng	It was this book that Tom bought yesterday.
4663429	eng	Tom doesn't usually stay up late at night.
4663478	eng	I think we could've done more to help Tom.
4663553	eng	Only three people attended Tom's funeral.
4663610	eng	Tom doesn't need to cancel his vacation.
4663706	eng	Tom is a close personal friend of mine.
4664091	eng	Tom should get down here right away.
4664100	eng	Tom is going to eat with us tonight.
4664191	eng	I started studying French last year.
4664355	eng	Do you still have feelings for Tom?
4664486	eng	I'm clearly doing something wrong.
4664610	eng	The fire caused extensive damage.
4664645	eng	I wish we didn't have to do that.
4664680	eng	You should have your car washed.
4664705	eng	Tom won't be the only one there.
4664885	eng	Does the government really care?
4664926	eng	Tom will wait for us, won't he?
4664969	eng	Tom has all the money he needs.
4665045	eng	The contract expired on Monday.
4665304	eng	It's unclear why Tom did that.
4665391	eng	We need to change the system.
4665428	eng	Tom is coming back to Boston.
4665467	eng	Tom doesn't have to eat this.
4665554	eng	I hate cleaning the bathroom.
4665589	eng	Why don't people believe me?
4665672	eng	Tom doesn't need me anymore.
4665726	eng	The trail is clearly marked.
4665833	eng	Would this afternoon be OK?
4665974	eng	Tom continued to date Mary.
4666008	eng	That would fix the problem.
4666032	eng	I wonder who that could be.
4666055	eng	French isn't hard to learn.
4666142	eng	Tom has a lovely daughter.
4666199	eng	The bus burst into flames.
4666239	eng	I urgently need your help.
4666415	eng	Tom could've walked away.
4666432	eng	They're completely wrong.
4666508	eng	Be original for a change.
4666576	eng	Tom has to take it easy.
4666865	eng	Tom seems to be bored.
4666995	eng	Tom has done so much.
4667058	eng	How fast is too fast?
4667143	eng	Tom is trying hard.
4667263	eng	Tom is strange.
4669319	eng	Can I join?
4672684	eng	Detroit has one of the highest levels of gun violence in the world.
4680104	eng	I can't do all of this.
4681375	eng	This Joseph will run.
4688784	eng	Instead of her, her sister went with them.
4694097	eng	The jury began deliberating on Monday.
4694898	eng	I don't want to go to work!
4695566	eng	The world is full of problems.
4699566	eng	Is this your obsession?
4700078	eng	Tom can do it better than me.
4700461	eng	She's Thai.
4701631	eng	I understand things. I have a mouth and I can speak.
4702990	eng	I always want to read that book.
4703066	eng	After he came, the party started.
4715833	eng	Tom seems to know a lot about me.
4716555	eng	The soldier gave me water.
4717284	eng	He does not speak English.
4717516	eng	We've never gone this way, have we?
4719412	eng	You'll be there, won't you?
4719422	eng	There's a stark difference in background and ideology between the two presidential candidates.
4727540	eng	Tom was supposed to call around 2:30.
4728297	eng	You can't be young.
4730921	eng	Tom doesn't play with his toys anymore.
4736976	eng	I think I'm coming down with a fever.
4740220	eng	Compasses point north.
4740259	eng	Tom couldn't say anything else.
4752629	eng	Actually, it would be much more sensible to do it later.
4752704	eng	Train services have returned to normal after the strike.
4753297	eng	I have to return some books to the library.
4753765	eng	Someone told me about that.
4769368	eng	Venus has no moons.
4774127	eng	I know that you meant well when you gave me that suggestion, and I'm offering advice to you in the same spirit.
4776310	eng	Was Tom here when we got here?
4779132	eng	Robert Smith is the singer of the group The Cure.
4781608	eng	Health is more important than gold.
4781612	eng	What comes from the heart, goes into the heart.
4786603	eng	Tom is saving up money so he can go to Australia.
4788775	eng	What do you love supremely, far and away more than anything else?
4800304	eng	Due to Tom's behavior, the court is convinced that Mary's account is accurate.
4804748	eng	Mary doesn't like men who speak like Tom.
4806097	eng	These diamonds come from South Africa.
4806959	eng	My father always speaks to me in French and my mother always speaks to me in English.
4814008	eng	It is possible to access the Internet without a wire.
4816973	eng	The packing list for the business trip includes an umbrella, gloves, and a belt.
4817059	eng	We shouldn't have tried doing that without Tom's help.
4822646	eng	What are you doing in my office?
4823164	eng	There was a knock on the door. "Who's there?" asked Tom. "It is I," answered Mary.
4823659	eng	Since I cannot speak about Tom's entire life, I will speak about my own experiences with him.
4823664	eng	My watch is not working correctly.
4831019	eng	I had four children.
4833002	eng	Do you know any good Korean restaurants.
4838950	eng	Wherever you go, I will go too.
4840421	eng	As Tom and John walked off the basketball court, Tom turned to John and said, "Good game."
4846732	eng	Maybe we should switch jobs.
4848348	eng	This was a state-sponsored criminal act.
4850046	eng	It was a great debate.
4853256	eng	The slopes of the mountain and the trees were all covered in snow.
4853375	eng	Tom is too depressed to work.
4866968	eng	I eat pineapple sherbert.
4867611	eng	Tom was rushed to a local hospital.
4869723	eng	I am master of all the birds in the world, and have only to blow my whistle and every one will come to me.
4870479	eng	Tom didn't get into details.
4875192	eng	I was overseas at the time.
4876081	eng	That decision will have far-reaching and serious consequences.
4879979	eng	I'm disappointed with your performance.
4887821	eng	I don't know my IQ.
4887848	eng	I do realize that.
4889737	eng	Let's not do that again.
4889742	eng	Tom did a wonderful job.
4889754	eng	We both did really well.
4889772	eng	What'll Tom do about it?
4890056	eng	Did Tom need help?
4890815	eng	We don't make anything anymore.
4894976	eng	I feel like I have to go pee!
4895461	eng	A language is much more than just a communication tool.
4895476	eng	This should be obvious, but apparently it's not.
4895595	eng	The Russians have never lived as bad as under the Obama administration.
4902565	eng	Sandbags can be used to erect a temporary wall to protect against floods.
4902758	eng	I'm going to drive downtown.
4902785	eng	The store is almost empty.
4908363	eng	Do you need an umbrella?
4910476	eng	There are two things you never turn down: sex and appearing on television.
4913156	eng	What would Tom say if he walked in right now?
4913187	eng	I try to avoid going into the woods after dark.
4914422	eng	Did he really do that? You couldn't make it up!
4915747	eng	It's been very frustrating.
4918108	eng	He likes to eat raw carrots.
4918940	eng	Can't you just go away?
4919036	eng	We're going to be here all afternoon.
4920113	eng	He was obviously very sick.
4928207	eng	Don't touch my sandwich!
4931477	eng	That surprise witness was the defense's trump card.
4931502	eng	It isn't fair that you are wealthier than she is.
4933175	eng	He wants to read this book.
4933460	eng	Everybody was waiting the same fate - death.
4934124	eng	Unfortunately, I have to start going.
4937822	eng	Things aren't happening fast enough.
4939720	eng	The actress' skin has makeup on it.
4940021	eng	The First Solar System War in the year 2685 devastated parts of Earth.
4943515	eng	Ami, what are you doing?
4945666	eng	She lounged by the pool.
4949477	eng	A wise leader knows when to listen to others.
4949666	eng	They're going to have a lot more questions than we do.
4950735	eng	Some of you need help.
4966419	eng	That's just what the doctor ordered.
4969840	eng	It shocked me.
4978838	eng	Compact washing machines are expensive for their size.
4979483	eng	He returned from Denmark.
4980097	eng	I think it'd be fun.
4980206	eng	I'll be meeting with Tom.
4982559	eng	I am studying French by myself.
4984714	eng	I'm taking my time.
4985838	eng	Waking up is an annoying way to start a day.
4987979	eng	A computer program is a list of instructions that tell the computer what to do.
4989148	eng	Maybe you will come to see us when you have free time.
4990965	eng	This match is NID, not even gonna watch it.
4995830	eng	His splenetic father threatened to spank him if he didn't behave himself.
4998339	eng	I've never had trouble falling asleep.
4999054	eng	That almost made me laugh.
4999879	eng	I thought it was marvelous.
5000874	eng	It wasn't a bad day.
5001068	eng	Mary decided to quit smoking.
5001159	eng	The good you do today will be forgotten tomorrow. However, do good.
5001507	eng	She is busy typing up reports.
5003807	eng	It would have been better if you had gone to sleep immediately.
5004809	eng	This may not be true.
5005868	eng	Tom should really wear safety glasses.
5006335	eng	The housing situation showed no signs that it would improve.
5008764	eng	It was a good choice.
5008958	eng	We talk all the time.
5009628	eng	Tom won by three points.
5011002	eng	He was right behind me.
5011421	eng	You need to speak out.
5011523	eng	Tom pushed the food around his plate.
5012583	eng	Can you contact me?
5012744	eng	Tom tried to convince Mary not to do that.
5013009	eng	They never spoke to us.
5014139	eng	The golden rule of conduct is mutual toleration, seeing that we will never all think alike and we shall always see Truth in fragments and from different angles of vision.
5014324	eng	Tom is relatively my age and he's a singer. That doesn't happen every day.
5018417	eng	I want nothing from you.
5018965	eng	Don't ignore the most important question.
5020157	eng	Can you drive me to the airport tomorrow morning?
5024661	eng	Tom said he's no expert.
5024673	eng	Tom used to play guitar.
5030917	eng	I pretended that I didn't understand.
5035773	eng	I’m sorry, but I don’t want to be an emperor.
5038784	eng	Tom told Mary that he thought it wouldn't be good if she went there by herself.
5043205	eng	I like the way you take care of me.
5046400	eng	We've been told not to do that.
5050455	eng	It was obvious that she wanted to kiss me.
5051071	eng	You are my girlfriend.
5059607	eng	Starvation and disease were rampant among the lowest classes.
5062348	eng	You bought a parrot.
5063322	eng	No one was badly injured.
5065861	eng	There are more than 70 million Minecraft videos on YouTube.
5068372	eng	Is that only a coincidence?
5073536	eng	An animal can be much more dangerous when injured.
5075126	eng	Tom also likes horse racing.
5077156	eng	She plays hockey on the weekends.
5078165	eng	I'm sure that he'll come.
5078215	eng	Mary has been badly let down.
5078243	eng	I'm in two minds about going.
5078269	eng	The experiment was a conspicuous failure.
5078299	eng	Tom was a terrible teacher.
5081547	eng	They're alone over there.
5081617	eng	My hobbies are cooking and reading.
5082232	eng	Tom is a clever kid.
5082833	eng	It is very boring to have nothing to do.
5083993	eng	Oh well. That's no big deal.
5085193	eng	I don't know how to draw a bird.
5087350	eng	I don't like listening to children crying.
5088479	eng	Try not to make the same mistake twice.
5090019	eng	This isn't a trivial matter.
5094970	eng	He kept finding many pretexts.
5095320	eng	Are not you the cause of this for me?
5096434	eng	Everything that could go wrong, went wrong.
5096658	eng	The village I live in is very small.
5096660	eng	Do not think about those kinds of things.
5097809	eng	I really want to go to the beach this summer.
5098771	eng	Foxes scare me.
5099127	eng	I need to walk the talk.
5101973	eng	I sat in the car.
5103530	eng	Tom lost his mind.
5105509	eng	Although you are able to win, sometimes yield to a friend, since through deference, sweet friends are preserved.
5109259	eng	Stop spending so much time looking for love and spend more time working on yourself!
5109526	eng	Tom yelled at everybody.
5110654	eng	Tom snuck up behind Mary.
5110666	eng	Tom has other priorities.
5113445	eng	Tom has maintained his innocence.
5114209	eng	Tom said he thought Mary was with John.
5114791	eng	I love to be alive.
5115975	eng	Mary sorrowfully buried her mother.
5116511	eng	He didn't understand his joke.
5116598	eng	Tom and Mary are doing well.
5119745	eng	I bought a box of chocolates on the way to work as a gift for my colleagues.
5122678	eng	He can do what he wants.
5128365	eng	That store sells kitchen-ware.
5129603	eng	You don't even try that hard.
5130221	eng	Tom said that's what he's always wanted.
5130843	eng	The king is the best.
5132188	eng	That's especially true right now.
5137178	eng	If you study hard, you'll pass the exam.
5137189	eng	I doubt that this will work.
5137578	eng	It's important for us to remember that.
5139023	eng	Thank you for being concerned about my mental health.
5141128	eng	Love doesn't obey anyone.
5147314	eng	Tom looks worried now.
5150137	eng	I think that he's from Italy.
5151201	eng	Tom's coach likes him.
5151209	eng	Tom says he'll do the same thing we do.
5152654	eng	Tom doesn't study French anymore.
5152729	eng	I'm just minding my own business.
5152869	eng	They bought a house in Connemara last year.
5152887	eng	Call the doctor.
5153356	eng	Tom's blood type is O+.
5154809	eng	I think that we're ready to seal the deal.
5155163	eng	Tom says he plans to be in Boston next weekend.
5155181	eng	I wish I could sing as well as Tom.
5155364	eng	I'll stay in Berlin for ten days.
5158651	eng	You're all wrong.
5158715	eng	They're so funny.
5158818	eng	Please get out the homework.
5160606	eng	Tom took the axe and went to chop down some trees in the forest because he wanted to build a new barrier.
5160674	eng	Tom isn't very religious.
5162363	eng	They see him.
5164514	eng	I know you told me when you'd be coming, but I couldn't get there then.
5165023	eng	How did you get this injury on your foot?
5165570	eng	They asked me for my name, my address, and the purpose of my trip.
5165781	eng	Why didn't you just kiss Tom?
5168313	eng	I wish I had a couple of bottles of good wine.
5168369	eng	I wish more people felt the same way.
5168375	eng	I wish you'd stop calling me a liar.
5168442	eng	I wish Tom would just resign.
5168482	eng	I wish we had done that.
5170091	eng	One of my children was born with some unknown disease.
5170500	eng	The books are covered in dust.
5170521	eng	Are we talking about professionalism?
5171281	eng	I wish to speak with you.
5171690	eng	I've never bought jewelry.
5177200	eng	Well, I didn't want to say that your translation wasn't good, but just ask if another translation would be possible.
5177508	eng	Two hundred trained members of a South African fire brigade travelled more than 15,000 kilometres to help fight the huge forest fire in northern Alberta.
5178388	eng	Let's attack again.
5179236	eng	Let's get together again tomorrow.
5181095	eng	Let's wait here until the rain stops.
5181179	eng	Let's concentrate on what needs to be done today.
5183297	eng	Have you already paid for everything?
5186994	eng	I'm still working hard.
5187245	eng	I'm feeling really good.
5187337	eng	I had gray hair.
5189082	eng	I used to think that was true, but not anymore.
5189128	eng	I don't speak French as often as I used to.
5189188	eng	Tom used to be on the basketball team.
5189242	eng	Tom used to visit me all the time.
5189360	eng	I used to like Tom a lot.
5189373	eng	Tom is used to waiting.
5190374	eng	I don't miss home at all.
5192517	eng	Two of the soldiers were killed and the rest were captured.

5731957	eng	Tom likes to complicate things.
5732946	eng	Only Tom saw the killer's face.
5732963	eng	I'll be homeschooling my kids.
5732966	eng	I wouldn't say that right now.
5733021	eng	I couldn't bear to look at Tom.
5733031	eng	I really don't have an answer.
5733042	eng	I lived out there for a while.
5733216	eng	Better late than never, right?
5735008	eng	Tom made a shocking statement.
5735677	eng	It's not like I had a choice.
5735787	eng	Tom has been found not guilty.
5735945	eng	I cried frantically for help.
5736035	eng	Clearly the game has changed.
5736095	eng	You have everything to gain.
5736126	eng	I just can't believe Tom died.
5736150	eng	I fell madly in love with Tom.
5736167	eng	We've been too inconsistent.
5736171	eng	I couldn't be happier for Tom.
5736193	eng	We're making it up as we go.
5736270	eng	We just need to play better.
5736521	eng	That would've been too much.
5736596	eng	People are still recovering.
5736647	eng	Let's get to the main event.
5737386	eng	I can't afford heat or food.
5737452	eng	Don't come out of the attic.
5737771	eng	I'm sure Tom has a good side.
5737983	eng	Take a look at these tires.
5738124	eng	I'm still kind of unnerved.
5738319	eng	I experienced it firsthand.
5738441	eng	Be careful while traveling.
5738696	eng	We told them to surrender.
5738716	eng	Tom is a family man himself.
5738745	eng	We do care about the kids.
5739557	eng	Tom directed the production.
5740558	eng	Tom and Mary are both great.
5740637	eng	More charges are expected.
5740671	eng	Just grab a seat anywhere.
5740702	eng	I didn't get along with Tom.
5740798	eng	Tom worries about security.
5741180	eng	Tom was very aware of that.
5741302	eng	I hope no one was smoking.
5741359	eng	I can't take it seriously.
5742806	eng	Anybody can become famous.
5744388	eng	Tom got a little banged up.
5744407	eng	They're going to find us.
5744468	eng	There was no risk to you.
5744524	eng	The child died instantly.
5744535	eng	Tom called me on my mobile.
5744542	eng	That's what my wife wore.
5744654	eng	To stand out from other job applicants, you could make a cover video instead of writing a cover letter.
5744721	eng	Our friends are in there.
5744783	eng	Let's not confuse things.
5744827	eng	We can't let Tom down now.
5745182	eng	I don't control anything.
5745270	eng	Tom kept a goat for a pet.
5745351	eng	Tom is completely useless.
5745611	eng	I'd rather have Judas by my side.
5745937	eng	Tom died of typhoid fever.
5745994	eng	Tom brought it on himself.
5746201	eng	Tom's offer was declined.
5746341	eng	It's a no-win situation.
5746767	eng	Tom just made the change.
5747223	eng	The world has gone mad.
5747281	eng	That just blew me away.
5747365	eng	Last night was amazing.
5747377	eng	It's really remarkable.
5747418	eng	It'll all become clear.
5747420	eng	Tom was a real optimist.
5747455	eng	It really is sickening.
5747651	eng	I love your generosity.
5747938	eng	We may never find out.
5748023	eng	I remember watching Tom.
5748166	eng	The data is promising.
5748229	eng	Please stop boring us.
5748325	eng	It's a crime actually.
5748360	eng	It really was amazing.
5749459	eng	Mary looks good in that red dress.
5752052	eng	Tom hesitated at first.
5752073	eng	Tom has no self-esteem.
5752265	eng	Don't be so hasty, Tom.
5752299	eng	We had a lousy start.
5753238	eng	It should be stopped.
5753248	eng	Tom keeps bad company.
5753429	eng	How's it been so far?
5753433	eng	How secure is my job?
5753743	eng	We need more divers.
5753753	eng	We learned by doing.
5754514	eng	Make everyone happy.
5754547	eng	It's a nice feeling.
5754704	eng	Tom is a little high.
5756715	eng	What were we to do?
5756846	eng	Tom is now deceased.
5756873	eng	Tom is dark-skinned.
5757367	eng	No deal was struck.
5757412	eng	Tom became very ill.
5757567	eng	I loved every bite.
5757570	eng	I love red parrots.
5757602	eng	I don't want money.
5757714	eng	Are we bad parents?
5757716	eng	Tom didn't look OK.
5757749	eng	Tom can protect me.
5757814	eng	That was too late.
5757898	eng	I've been elected.
5758105	eng	The gun went off.
5758284	eng	Tom never reads.
5758295	eng	That must sting.
5758415	eng	Use caution.
5759263	eng	Here's what I'm doing.
5760080	eng	Is she in a good mood?
5762622	eng	Tom hasn't yet done what we asked him to do.
5762738	eng	When are we leaving?
5763189	eng	Tom doesn't go out with Mary anymore.
5769683	eng	Tom works at a super secret government facility.
5771966	eng	What's this town like?
5774038	eng	I believe in a liberal political order -- an order built not just through elections and representative government, but also through respect for human rights and civil society, and independent judiciaries and the rule of law.
5774052	eng	Human ingenuity now gives us the capacity to feed the hungry and give all of our children -- including our girls -- the education that is the foundation for opportunity in our world. But we have to put our money where our mouths are.
5774140	eng	We still have so much to learn.
5777153	eng	We're both telling the truth.
5779251	eng	You should have studied for the test.
5780473	eng	We hope a solution is found.
5785899	eng	Were you able to sit down?
5788627	eng	Mary knew that Tom hid food in his closet.
5788875	eng	I'd like to ask Tom a question.
5790030	eng	The viral outbreak occurred in the northern sector.
5790229	eng	Mary is upstairs with the baby.
5790235	eng	Turn down the music before you kill us all.
5791547	eng	Who could do this kind of thing?
5791760	eng	Mary punched Tom in the gut.
5792354	eng	Why do we talk so much about Tom?
5794076	eng	Marita's kids prefer watching anime dubbed in Tagalog.
5794322	eng	I have no time to write.
5795208	eng	Tom gave me back my dictionary.
5796870	eng	Actually we wanted to call our children Tom and Jerry. However because our second child was a girl they are now called Tom and Mary.
5797472	eng	I ate a hamburger for lunch.
5797542	eng	Your son is an angel.
5798115	eng	With her stomach full of milk, the baby fell asleep.
5803421	eng	Here's a list of things that we need to do before Monday.
5806139	eng	Tom has a talent for painting.
5806948	eng	Tom has a beeper.
5811750	eng	All the furniture in our house was made by Tom.
5812914	eng	I think we're just about finished.
5813327	eng	That's all you think about.
5813954	eng	Colour the picture.
5813975	eng	Does this mean that you're not going to go to Boston?
5816202	eng	Poverty is a systemic problem.
5816280	eng	Tom knows how to drive a car.
5817101	eng	I will sing you to sleep.
5817816	eng	I don't think anything can be done.
5817882	eng	Please don't mind him.
5819641	eng	I'll pick you up at eight.
5820070	eng	I feel I'm a good person.
5820529	eng	I'll stay here tonight.
5820585	eng	I think it's more interesting to look around the city.
5820713	eng	Tom promised he'd help us.
5821530	eng	Tom might be busy now.
5823074	eng	I wanna be a smart man like Jamal when I grow up.
5823115	eng	I wish Fadil could be a little more nice.
5824709	eng	Here sat Marilla Cuthbert, when she sat at all, always slightly distrustful of sunshine, which seemed to her too dancing and irresponsible a thing for a world which was meant to be taken seriously.
5824733	eng	Matthew dreaded all women except Marilla and Mrs. Rachel; he had an uncomfortable feeling that the mysterious creatures were secretly laughing at him.
5825014	eng	In the garden below were lilac-trees purple with flowers, and their dizzily sweet fragrance drifted up to the window on the morning wind.
5825150	eng	Mrs. Blewett darted her eyes over Anne from head to foot.
5825276	eng	I can't tell Mrs. Lynde I'm sorry I said those things to her. How can I? I'm not sorry.
5825532	eng	I suggested it.
5825581	eng	I was born in that house.
5825806	eng	I'm extremely grateful to you and Tom.
5825846	eng	I'll try not to think about what might go wrong.
5827390	eng	Tom begins his trip.
5828263	eng	I'll give that to you if you behave.
5828283	eng	You're thinking of unimportant things.
5828370	eng	Why didn't he tell me this before?
5828461	eng	I'm so afraid of him.
5828524	eng	Running was my only defense.
5828560	eng	Did you give her the tranquilizer?
5828605	eng	There was love and respect.
5828705	eng	I did well.
5828719	eng	My dad is going to whip me just like a donkey.
5828813	eng	Have you set the table?
5830210	eng	How would we get it done?
5831783	eng	"I don't think I was crying because I was really so very fond of him," reflected Anne. "I just cried because all the others did."
5831948	eng	I think I shouldn't make a decision without consulting Tom.
5832594	eng	I don't think they're safe.
5832596	eng	How did you get this idea?
5834517	eng	How would you like it if everyone called you stupid?
5834859	eng	Oh, Diana, if only the geometry examination were over!
5834872	eng	Tom is taller than his brother.
5836017	eng	I'm really busy right now.
5836141	eng	Maybe they had a fight.
5836289	eng	It doesn't matter. Not anymore.
5838221	eng	"God's in his heaven, all's right with the world," whispered Anne softly.
5838283	eng	Tom knows he has to be patient.
5838318	eng	How did we not know that this was going to happen?
5838768	eng	Fadil and Layla were tried separately for the murder of Rami Hasan.
5839141	eng	Layla got involved with a man who plays dirty.
5839225	eng	Dania continued to follow Fadil's lead.
5839474	eng	Fadil handed Dania a gun.
5839802	eng	How could something like that have gone unnoticed?
5839811	eng	Tom is sorry he got caught.
5839816	eng	Were you the one who painted this picture?
5839924	eng	I know a lot.
5840453	eng	I jumped bail.
5840488	eng	I expected it.
5844019	eng	Tom is a malignant narcissist.
5844802	eng	I haven't forgotten any of you.
5844826	eng	I like people who are friendly.
5845853	eng	How much is your life worth?
5846316	eng	Tom said he wanted to leave.
5846928	eng	I'm definitely going to do that.
5848280	eng	Tom was feeling pretty tired.
5848344	eng	I don't understand these questions.
5848513	eng	Tom didn't even talk about Mary.
5848563	eng	I think Tom would've enjoyed tonight's concert.
5848577	eng	Tom hopes to become a teacher.
5848967	eng	I didn't know we weren't supposed to help Tom.
5849067	eng	I did my best to calm Tom down.
5849085	eng	How did Tom know you were in Boston?
5849111	eng	I know Tom is going to hate this.
5849134	eng	I told Tom that I would help him.
5849144	eng	Make sure you don't do anything to upset Tom.
5849203	eng	I don't think that we did anything wrong.
5849204	eng	Tom sure likes oranges, doesn't he?
5849428	eng	Tom wouldn't do anything to help.
5849960	eng	I don't think it really matters who does this as long as it gets done.
5850062	eng	I was acquitted.
5850341	eng	Don't you dare try to do that.
5850389	eng	I grew a beard last summer.
5850502	eng	I've been here since this morning.
5850513	eng	How much have you invested so far?
5850702	eng	I overheard Tom and Mary talking about John.
5850728	eng	What did the specialist say?
5850980	eng	I'm very tough.
5851124	eng	I was inside, waiting.
5851318	eng	Tom is the former owner of this club.
5851423	eng	I have no plans at this point.
5851449	eng	We have to do it together.
5851461	eng	There's nothing else we can do here.
5851536	eng	I just don't have enough time.
5851960	eng	Tom knows he's better than Mary.
5851996	eng	I'm glad it's all working out.
5852075	eng	I have the flu.
5852129	eng	I have three DUIs.
5852313	eng	I drank a shot.
5852327	eng	I did it wrong.
5852460	eng	Go put some clothes on.
5852691	eng	Mary isn't beautiful.
5852741	eng	Why should we leave?
5852788	eng	That's not likely to happen in my lifetime.
5852826	eng	I thought it might be fun to eat out for a change.
5852877	eng	I don't have to do that anymore.
5853061	eng	I was focused.
5853083	eng	Why can't we walk?
5853168	eng	I've already decided what to do.
5853259	eng	I have friends in many countries.
5853287	eng	I meant to ask you that question.
5853818	eng	You can count on me, Tom.
5856413	eng	Tom needs to mow his lawn.
5858106	eng	I was indiscreet.
5858132	eng	I want to stop Tom from doing that.
5858163	eng	Tom tricked me into doing that.
5858185	eng	I'm a bad golfer.
5858189	eng	I play lacrosse.
5858193	eng	Tom came close to doing that.
5858221	eng	I'm a fast eater.
5858428	eng	I agreed to that.
5858532	eng	I arrived in time.
5858540	eng	I tasted the stew.
5858605	eng	I broke the rules.
5858965	eng	Tom was heroic.
5858976	eng	I'm not too happy.
5858977	eng	Tom got mugged.
5859248	eng	I greeted everyone.
5859304	eng	I fumbled the ball.
5859325	eng	I unfolded the map.
5859532	eng	I spiked the punch.
5859552	eng	I asked Tom to drive.
5859868	eng	I could've drowned.
5859871	eng	I gave up too soon.
5859928	eng	The fly is stuck against the window.
5860071	eng	Hypocrisy is a revolting, psychopathic state.
5860658	eng	You're hard to please.
5860777	eng	I don't like jazz so much.
5860793	eng	I turned off the TV.
5861535	eng	The request for more American assistance could foment a diplomatic crisis with China.
5861572	eng	Chomsky tackled problems of international relations later in his career.
5868574	eng	"You're beautiful today." "You're a charmer."
5871070	eng	Do you speak Farsi?
5871474	eng	The Wise Old Elf lives in the same tree as Ben in room ninety-eight.
5872057	eng	There was an eye-to-eye confrontation between Fadil and Rami.
5873830	eng	The post has arrived.
5879181	eng	I put my wallet right here.
5879232	eng	Layla was a beautiful Egyptian immigrant.
5879428	eng	I don't know whether Fadil was joking or trying to shock the psychiatrist, but he claimed that he ate some of Layla's flesh.
5879455	eng	Fadil's wife, his brother and his father-in-law all died that year.
5879595	eng	I think my tire is flat.
5881256	eng	I wanna be a Muslim.
5882195	eng	You are my sand; I am your wave; sweat is our sea.
5882878	eng	Fadil thought of his wife as a possession.
5882904	eng	Fadil was suspiscious of medication.
5883049	eng	It takes a cold heart to neglect a little girl in need.
5884658	eng	"Are you a student?" "Yes."
5884681	eng	"Did you see that movie?" "Yes."
5885783	eng	Were it left to me to decide whether we should have a government without newspapers or newspapers without a government, I should not hesitate a moment to prefer the latter.
5886581	eng	Fadil became like a complete doormat.
5888892	eng	If I wanted to, I could do that.
5892430	eng	Fadil was severely damaged.
5892479	eng	That was Fadil's view.
5894393	eng	I will take that as a yes.
5895573	eng	Layla was tired of being the other woman.
5898046	eng	The boy is learning to read and write.
5902297	eng	The thing about cheese is that no extraterrestrials have ever consumed it.
5902381	eng	I've often wondered what species of mammal has the most teats.
5902640	eng	Fadil faced his third murder trial.
5902671	eng	Layla was a charming woman.
5902860	eng	Who's the boss?
5902894	eng	Tom is a cat lover.
5904703	eng	I'm still not entirely comfortable with this.
5904840	eng	Tom told Mary that he was going to try to help John.
5904856	eng	Tom has been nice to me, but I still don't like him.
5907362	eng	I consider this as the ultimate betrayal.
5907418	eng	The charge was reduced to manslaughter.
5907464	eng	The rescue came too late.
5909691	eng	I'm beginning to have second thoughts.
5909775	eng	I often take a nap right after lunch.
5909862	eng	Tom is talking to the French teacher right now.
5909909	eng	I'm not likely to be there tonight.
5910028	eng	Tom is smarter than you probably think he is.
5913171	eng	Would you mind helping me a bit?
5914777	eng	Steve was not reassured by the disclaimer.
5915050	eng	No one has ever been tortured the way Sami was.
5915239	eng	I enjoyed myself at your party last weekend.
5915276	eng	Tom had fun walking in the park with Mary.
5915279	eng	I shuffled the cards and then dealt them.
5915401	eng	I've found myself a new girlfriend.
5915480	eng	I thought you said you were busy.
5915746	eng	I still have a long way to go.
5915760	eng	You don't seem to like Tom very much.
5915845	eng	I usually take a bus to work.
5915942	eng	Tom is waiting for Mary to call him.
5916028	eng	Tom was shot in front of his house.
5916072	eng	Tom is very hard to get along with.
5916165	eng	You seem to be happy here.
5916185	eng	I've done a lot this week.
5916194	eng	Tom says he doesn't need our help.
5916262	eng	Tom blushed when Mary praised him.
5916312	eng	Tom tore up the letter from Mary.
5916333	eng	I was in Boston recently.
5916352	eng	Tom is waiting for Mary to leave.
5916580	eng	I think it was Tom who did that.
5917167	eng	I can't remember the last time I was so happy.
5919514	eng	"This is a very good brand," said Dad.
5921270	eng	Sami bought some ornamental plants.
5922026	eng	Doesn't language death make communication easier?
5922082	eng	The word's provenance is unclear.
5924004	eng	Stereotypes exist for a reason.
5924037	eng	Didn't you see the stop sign? You could have had us killed!
5924043	eng	This is made of wood.
5924076	eng	The computer's not working.
5928107	eng	Layla was paying for Sami's addiction to alcohol.
5933695	eng	In order to learn an indigenous or minority language, it is often necessary to learn the dominant language of the region or country.
5933737	eng	Such is life in Russia.
5936173	eng	Tom is attracted to girls.
5936366	eng	We never stay in Boston for more than a couple of weeks.
5936417	eng	Tom is trained to deal with these kinds of problems.
5936616	eng	I've never lived anywhere other than Boston.
5936654	eng	We need to find a solution to this problem.
5936657	eng	Tom was surprised that Mary won the prize.
5936680	eng	You've always been easy to get along with.
5936779	eng	Tom thought Mary's plan was a good one.
5936823	eng	What do you admire the most about Tom?
5937044	eng	Tom is no longer afraid of the dark.
5937098	eng	Tom had been missing for three days.
5937710	eng	I devour books of poetry.

6207090	eng	Prosperity is only an instrument to be used, not a deity to be worshipped.
6207279	eng	Do you have much free time?
6207489	eng	He answered by smiling.
6211509	eng	I have never seen such magnificent landscapes. I hope with all my heart that in the sky we can paint.
6211544	eng	And thereupon began a mighty combat between George and the dragon; and whenever the dragon came near to George his dog would spring at one of his paws, and when one of the heads reared back to deal with it George's horse would spring to that side, and George's sword would sweep that head away.
6211587	eng	"Thieving is thieving," said the Beast, "whether it be a rose or a diamond; thy life is forfeit."
6211729	eng	About fifteen or sixteen years after, the King and Queen being absent at one of their country villas, the young Princess was one day running up and down the palace; she went from room to room, and at last she came into a little garret on the top of the tower, where a good old woman, alone, was spinning with her spindle.
6212506	eng	Every superfluous garment was thrown aside, and the sun beamed forth as if desirous of gazing at the charms which were exposed to his rays.
6212574	eng	Are you in Naples?
6212735	eng	Thus plundering as they went, the soldiers landed at last on the estate where Daphnis and Chloe pastured their goats and sheep, and carried off whatever spoil they could find.
6213456	eng	Daphnis has forgotten me. He is dreaming of marrying some wealthy maiden.
6214565	eng	Look what you did to him.
6216615	eng	Is it dinner already?
6217025	eng	They are not widely available on campus.
6218110	eng	After returning from war, many soldiers show signs of post-traumatic stress syndrome.
6218407	eng	The teacher asked the students to place their chairs in a semicircle.
6219055	eng	He wears those beads on his arm as a fashion statement.
6220217	eng	I know everyone here.
6220318	eng	Tom may do that again.
6220437	eng	Tom might not be thirsty.
6220634	eng	I was unable to do that.
6220708	eng	Tom may become violent.
6220728	eng	Tom ought to do that again.
6220900	eng	Tom is going to miss Mary.
6220905	eng	You might have to do that.
6220995	eng	Tom and I both have beards.
6221133	eng	I'd never do that by myself.
6221144	eng	My wife is a scientist, too.
6221176	eng	Tom and I were both shocked.
6221223	eng	Tom knows that he has to do that.
6221291	eng	Both Tom and I aren't hungry.
6221382	eng	Both Tom and I were in shock.
6221425	eng	Tom knows where everyone is.
6221538	eng	I switched off the microphone.
6221550	eng	It may not be hard to do that.
6221614	eng	Tom and I were both exhausted.
6221618	eng	Tom and I were both surprised.
6221622	eng	Tom ate twice as much as Mary ate.
6221626	eng	Tom baked an apple pie for us.
6221835	eng	Tom is having a good time as well.
6221911	eng	Tom should've never been there.
6221922	eng	Tom will unlikely do that today.
6221947	eng	Everybody wanted to go to Boston.
6222064	eng	Tom won't be back until October.
6222372	eng	Tom will do that right the next time.
6222418	eng	Everyone was completely worn out.
6222419	eng	Everybody was completely worn out.
6222558	eng	Tom hasn't told me what to do yet.
6222673	eng	All of your answers were incorrect.
6222685	eng	Does anyone here understand French?
6222782	eng	Tom didn't want anyone to do that.
6222815	eng	Tom has never allowed me to drive his car.
6222872	eng	Tom may have missed the last train.
6222940	eng	Tom will get you in trouble.
6222953	eng	What do you usually have for dinner?
6223041	eng	Tom can rest as long as he wants to.
6223159	eng	Tom said he thought Mary wasn't angry.
6223181	eng	Tom says he doesn't like to do that.
6223217	eng	We did that a lot when we were children.
6223223	eng	You're a better swimmer than Tom is.
6223354	eng	Tom has apparently not yet done that.
6223358	eng	Tom has been gone nearly three years.
6223638	eng	Tom didn't think Mary would be so mad.
6223703	eng	Tom is trying to protect his kids.
6223952	eng	Tom will get suspicious if you do that.
6224016	eng	Tom said he's already done all of that.
6224030	eng	Tom says you might not have to do that.
6224041	eng	Tom will do that this afternoon.
6224100	eng	I might not be able to do that tomorrow.
6224153	eng	Both Tom and I were wearing black coats.
6224363	eng	I think it might be hard to do that.
6224423	eng	Tom has twice as many books as Mary does.
6224471	eng	Tom said Mary's not permitted to do that.
6224535	eng	Would you mind doing that somewhere else?
6224722	eng	Tom said you're a better singer than Mary.
6224746	eng	Tom will be very impressed by that.
6225285	eng	You shouldn't use somebody else's toothbrush.
6225503	eng	Maybe the only one here who can do that is Tom.
6225514	eng	Tom began writing poems when he was very young.
6225576	eng	Tom said that he wasn't planning to do that.
6225865	eng	Tom thinks that doing that might not be a bad idea.
6225952	eng	Tom doesn't see why anybody would want to do that.
6225994	eng	Tom told Mary that he thought John wasn't alone.
6226143	eng	You're planning to do that tomorrow, aren't you?
6226266	eng	Everybody but Tom knew that he didn't have to do that.
6226356	eng	Both Tom and I stared at Mary without saying anything.
6226439	eng	Tom has no idea what kind of car Mary drives.
6226752	eng	I know that you and Tom are planning to do that together.
6226804	eng	Tom told Mary that she should quit pretending to be thirsty.
6226840	eng	Tom told Mary that she should quit pretending to be homesick.
6226893	eng	Tom says he doesn't know who Mary is planning to give that to.
6226923	eng	Tom said he didn't know Mary was going to eventually do that.
6226965	eng	Tom is going to be very thirsty after working all day in the hot sun.
6227395	eng	You should probably tell Tom that he needs to be more careful the next time he does that.
6227505	eng	I was about to do that, but something came up and I didn't have a chance to.
6227600	eng	I told Tom that I didn't think you'd be able to do that without my help.
6227654	eng	I don't want to wear the shirt that my mother gave me for my birthday.
6227664	eng	I doubt very seriously that Tom will think it's a good idea to do that.
6227759	eng	You told Tom I didn't have to do that anymore, didn't you?
6228009	eng	I know that Tom is satisfied.
6228064	eng	I didn't know how to ask Tom to leave without hurting his feelings.
6228398	eng	I didn't think Tom was tired.
6228463	eng	I wish I hadn't tried driving home after I had drunk so much.
6228543	eng	I didn't have enough money to buy everything I wanted to buy.
6228614	eng	Why's Tom staying in Boston?
6228678	eng	What you did made Tom happy.
6228849	eng	I wasn't surprised when Tom told me I didn't have to do that.
6228897	eng	I don't think Tom will ever be able to afford to buy a house.
6228939	eng	Did you know there was a Chinese restaurant on Park Street?
6228973	eng	You know that Tom can't do that as well as I can, don't you?
6229104	eng	I don't yet know if Tom will go camping with us or not.
6229176	eng	I didn't know that Tom was supposed to help us do that.
6229219	eng	How much more time do you think it'll take you to do that?
6229512	eng	I thought Tom said he didn't know how use a chain saw.
6229528	eng	I think Tom would like to be the first one to do that.
6229582	eng	Has Tom ever studied French?
6229655	eng	You and I both know what'll happen if you don't do that.
6229811	eng	Maybe Tom can teach French.
6230169	eng	I still haven't told Tom why I don't have to do that.
6230275	eng	How much more time do you think you'll have to do that?
6230536	eng	I thought you were supposed to be in Boston this week.
6230822	eng	I knew Tom was going to be arrested sooner or later.
6230875	eng	Tom didn't know that he was supposed to do that by himself.
6231011	eng	I didn't know why Tom wouldn't accept my invitation.
6231102	eng	I don't like being the one who always has to do that.
6231220	eng	Tom was the first person who has ever offered to help me.
6231250	eng	Do you really think it would be expensive to do that?
6231429	eng	I wonder if Tom is really as rich as he says he is.
6231678	eng	Tom said it probably wouldn't take much time to do that.
6231685	eng	I didn't think it would be safe for Tom to do that.
6231709	eng	I didn't tell Tom anything about what had happened.
6231723	eng	I think Tom is depressed.
6231757	eng	I didn't know Tom would have to do that by himself.
6231816	eng	I know that Tom is funny.
6231981	eng	You'll likely lose some weight if follow this diet.
6232123	eng	Tom says he can't stand people who do things like that.
6232186	eng	I thought you said you'd keep Tom from doing that.
6232278	eng	I'd rather do that now while it's still not so hot.
6232362	eng	I don't understand why I'm not supposed to do that.
6232490	eng	How often do you change the strings on your guitar?
6232689	eng	Tom said he wasn't going to get here until about 2:30.
6232893	eng	I know Tom pretty well.
6233185	eng	Tom said that was the first time he'd ever done that.
6233240	eng	I don't like the same kind of movies as Tom does.
6233392	eng	How many more days do you think Tom will do that?
6233420	eng	Doing that the way Tom suggested would be better.
6233458	eng	I think Tom is tired.
6233789	eng	Is Tom the only one who doesn't have to do that?
6233841	eng	I wish I hadn't parked my car next to Tom's car.
6234207	eng	Tom told me why it would be a good idea to do that.
6234564	eng	Tom has been in the waiting room for the past hour.
6234928	eng	You're the only person who can help me do that.
6234933	eng	Tom said he saw a lot of dead animals on the road.
6235000	eng	You should be able to do that without any help.
6235093	eng	You didn't have to do that right away, did you?
6235128	eng	Tom doesn't think I'm going to be able to do that.
6235447	eng	Tom said we weren't permitted to do that anymore.
6235625	eng	How many days will it actually take to do that?
6235677	eng	I didn't want to tell Tom about what happened.
6235866	eng	Did you know that Tom was in Boston last year?
6235975	eng	Tom won't likely be awake at this time of night.
6236003	eng	It'll take you at least three days to do that.
6236192	eng	I thought you'd be through doing that by 2:30.
6236585	eng	How many times did you go surfing last summer?
6236674	eng	Tom won't likely be impressed with this report.
6236745	eng	You should tell Tom I won't do that anymore.
6236768	eng	Tom thought he'd be able to do that by himself.
6236866	eng	The only one here who has to do that is Tom.
6236967	eng	There's no way I could've refused to do that.
6236984	eng	Tom said he had something to do this afternoon.
6236989	eng	I told Tom that I thought you could do that.
6236996	eng	Tom said he doesn't want to do that on his own.
6237008	eng	Tom said he didn't want to go to Boston by bus.
6237064	eng	I think Tom will be able to help us do that.
6237296	eng	Tom had a very tough time making friends there.
6237332	eng	Tom doesn't think it's safe for you to do that.
6237391	eng	How often does Tom go to Boston on business?
6237400	eng	How many seconds did it take Tom to do that?
6237480	eng	I didn't know how much money had been stolen.
6237583	eng	You don't think Tom should do that, do you?
6237756	eng	You really like doing that a lot, don't you?
6238049	eng	Tom just wants to stay at home in his pajamas.
6238197	eng	I should've known that I couldn't trust you.
6238593	eng	Do you know anyone who has gotten a divorce?
6238882	eng	I tried to convince Tom to do that for us.
6238884	eng	You don't enjoy doing that anymore, do you?
6238974	eng	What were you doing last week at this time?
6239448	eng	I didn't know Tom wasn't going to do that.
6239724	eng	Don't forget to tell Mary to do that today.
6239977	eng	I think Tom might visit Boston next week.
6240036	eng	Which one of your children went to Boston?
6240100	eng	I haven't told Tom why I have to do that.
6240135	eng	Please remind me to pay the rent tomorrow.
6240218	eng	I don't know where Tom put his suitcases.
6240505	eng	I thought doing that might be a good idea.
6240528	eng	Tom could've done that, but he chose not to.
6240752	eng	Is Tom going to play the guitar tonight?
6240759	eng	Tom wasn't supposed to do that, but he did.
6240785	eng	I'm sure Tom doesn't want to be outside.
6240917	eng	I thought Tom looked nervous doing that.
6241020	eng	Tom said trying to do that was frustrating.
6241485	eng	Tom has promised to never to do that again.
6241754	eng	The answer Tom gave seemed wrong to me.
6241823	eng	I've already forgotten Tom's last name.
6241843	eng	I thought I was going to win the contest.
6241898	eng	I want to see if Tom likes my new song.
6241914	eng	Tom and I started talking at the same time.
6241947	eng	Tom and I go camping together every summer.
6242002	eng	I hope I don't have to work this weekend.
6242020	eng	I don't want to work on an assembly line.
6242058	eng	Tom will get into trouble if he does that.
6242130	eng	Tom waited three hours and then went home.
6242138	eng	I hope Tom is interested in doing that.
6242153	eng	I haven't yet done that since Tom left.
6242159	eng	I have to do that before Tom gets here.
6242358	eng	I didn't think that Tom was having fun.
6242416	eng	Tom said he'll be the last one to do that.
6242417	eng	Doing that is a lot easier than it looks.
6242520	eng	How often do you go to Boston with Tom?
6242722	eng	You don't still need to do that, do you?
6243107	eng	I should tell Tom what has to be done.
6243283	eng	Tom and I seldom give each other presents.
6243308	eng	I should be finished doing that by 2:30.
6243509	eng	Tom wants me to go to the dance with him.
6243521	eng	Tom wanted to be at home with his family.
6243528	eng	I don't go fishing as much as I used to.
6243601	eng	Do you think Tom should do that alone?
6243627	eng	Tom should be through doing that by 2:30.
6243781	eng	Do you know anyone who's good at French?
6243833	eng	It would be nice to do that with Tom.
6243858	eng	Tom said he wanted to do that by himself.
6243932	eng	I wonder if Tom has done that before.
6244099	eng	Tom knows that won't happen anytime soon.
6244133	eng	Wouldn't it be better to do that today?
6244303	eng	Tom has finally decided to call it quits.
6244314	eng	I don't know why Tom let you do that.
6244322	eng	There's just no way that I can do that.
6244362	eng	I don't know if Tom will come or not.
6244444	eng	Tom doesn't often show his true feelings.
6244517	eng	Tom didn't tell me why he had to do that.
6244693	eng	You promised you'd help Tom do that.
6244737	eng	I should be through doing that by 2:30.
6244879	eng	I'm looking forward to visiting Tom.
6244932	eng	Tom wants to surprise you by doing that.
6244984	eng	I don't need any help with my homework.
6245032	eng	I don't have to go to Boston next week.
6245139	eng	Tom seems to be doing that a lot lately.
6245165	eng	I hope Tom won't want me to do that.
6245258	eng	I don't think Tom will be back soon.
6245325	eng	Tom said he'd do that as soon as he can.
6245470	eng	All three of us overslept this morning.
6245570	eng	Do you think Tom could be in Boston?
6245582	eng	Didn't you know Tom lived in Boston?
6245605	eng	You were a child prodigy, weren't you?
6245792	eng	It was last year that Tom did that.
6245809	eng	You agreed not to do that, didn't you?
6245818	eng	Would you like something hot to drink?
6245861	eng	I wouldn't tell Tom how to do that.
6245898	eng	Tom got on his motorcycle and rode away.
6245907	eng	Tom gave the same answer he always does.
6245949	eng	Tom doesn't seem to know how to do that.
6246000	eng	Tom doesn't know exactly how to do that.
6246025	eng	My car gets thirty kilometers a liter.
6246027	eng	Tom doesn't actually live in Boston now.
6246039	eng	Tom died on the morning of October 20th.
6246093	eng	Tom did everything he felt he had to do.
6246353	eng	I didn't think Tom would be scared.
6246492	eng	Tom told me that he's ready to do that.
6246494	eng	I can't believe Tom is over thirty.
6246542	eng	Does Tom have to be doing that now?
6246634	eng	I knew I might be required to do that.
6246682	eng	Tom says he wants more money than that.
6246755	eng	I don't think I'll be able to do that.
6246779	eng	I don't think I can do that by myself.
6246813	eng	I'm sure Tom won't object to that.
6246819	eng	I'm sure Tom hasn't forgotten you.
6246847	eng	Tom said he hoped to be back on Monday.
6246849	eng	I wonder why Tom wants to do that.
6246856	eng	Tom said he didn't want to get married.
6246923	eng	I didn't tell anyone who I really was.
6247163	eng	Doing that was easier than I expected.
6247301	eng	You're the smartest one in our class.
6247349	eng	You'll have to find a way to do that.
6247393	eng	Tom has been suspended for three weeks.
6247424	eng	You should be done doing that by now.
6247752	eng	I'll ask Tom to buy that for you.
6247820	eng	Just make sure you get there on time.
6247924	eng	Tom and I hugged and kissed each other.
6247979	eng	I'm still willing to do that for you.
6248216	eng	I still have a thousand things to do.
6248348	eng	I gained a lot of weight last summer.
6248528	eng	Tom says he doesn't intend to do that.
6248554	eng	Will Tom be doing that tomorrow?
6248754	eng	How many ways do you know to do that?
6248798	eng	Tom said he believed he could do that.
6248927	eng	Tom must've been desperate to do that.
6249000	eng	You'd be able to do that, wouldn't you?
6249194	eng	Tom is likely to still be pessimistic.
6249535	eng	I've made up my mind not to do that.
6249695	eng	Why didn't Tom have to do that?
6249751	eng	I thought I could do that by myself.
6249798	eng	Tom died on his way back to Australia.
6249852	eng	I may be living in Boston next year.
6249854	eng	Tom didn't know that I had to do that.
6249894	eng	I hope that I don't have to do that.
6249926	eng	I had intended to do that yesterday.
6250098	eng	Tom and I watched the sunset together.
6250196	eng	I know that Tom is competitive.
6250206	eng	Tom almost froze to death in the snow.
6250212	eng	Tom actually does want you to do that.
6250305	eng	Tom won't listen to anything you say.
6250329	eng	Tom won't be allowed to do that here.
6250484	eng	I didn't think Tom was worried.
6250563	eng	Tom stuck the broken pieces together.
6250601	eng	How did Tom propose to do that?
6250618	eng	You're the only one here I've told.
6250653	eng	Didn't you know Tom was lonely?
6250680	eng	Ask Tom what he wants to watch.
6250788	eng	Warn Tom not to do that again.
6250861	eng	Tom said that he intended to do that.
6250887	eng	I've persuaded Tom to do that.
6250888	eng	Tom said his parents have been there.
6251152	eng	Tom plans to be back on October 20th.
6251196	eng	I know that Tom is prejudiced.
6251354	eng	I won't be studying French tonight.
6251574	eng	Do you know why Tom is crying?
6251926	eng	Tom said I was the one who should tell Mary she shouldn't do that anymore.
6252218	eng	Tom did that because you told him to.
6252220	eng	Tom said he thought Mary might not be permitted to do that by herself.
6252319	eng	Tom said Mary was likely to be the one responsible for what happened.
6252356	eng	Tom began doing that at an early age.
6252698	eng	I don't think Tom will be able to convince Mary to stop doing that.
6252819	eng	Tom still isn't very good at skiing.
6253179	eng	Tom said he won't forget that night.
6253234	eng	I shouldn't have reacted that way.
6253323	eng	Tom said he wished he hadn't tried to convince Mary to do that.
6253351	eng	Tom recommended that we not do that.
6253521	eng	Tom says he didn't know Mary would have to do that by herself.
6253623	eng	Tom probably doesn't know why Mary doesn't want me to do that.
6253631	eng	I don't have to do that by myself.
6253692	eng	Tom and Mary must've been tired when they got home last night.
6253694	eng	I didn't want anyone else to know.
6253866	eng	Tom said he hoped Mary would be able to learn how to do that.
6253945	eng	Tom is a pretty good French speaker.
6254023	eng	Tom has told me he wants to do that.
6254052	eng	I didn't think Tom would be able to convince Mary to do that.
6254136	eng	Tom said that wasn't the real reason Mary wanted to do that.
6254220	eng	You're one of our best customers.
6254348	eng	Tom fell in love with his therapist.
6254413	eng	Tom said that Mary thought doing that would be interesting.
6254415	eng	You can stay here if you want to.
6254518	eng	Tom said Mary knew he might not have to do that by himself.
6254527	eng	Tom probably doesn't know why Mary doesn't want to do that.
6254755	eng	Tom said he thought he wouldn't enjoy traveling with Mary.
6254782	eng	Tom said he hoped Mary would be able to come to his party.
6254930	eng	Tom always does that in the evening.
6255054	eng	I wish I had done that yesterday.
6255082	eng	Tom should probably not tell Mary what she wants to know.
6255091	eng	Tom seemed surprised when I told him Mary had to do that.
6255275	eng	Tom suggested we visit that museum.
6255337	eng	Tom didn't want to know why Mary doesn't want to do that.
6255372	eng	I hope we didn't break any rules.
6255407	eng	Tom should've been fired years ago.
6255438	eng	Tom told me that he thought Mary could probably do that.
6255569	eng	I don't have to be here tomorrow.
6255632	eng	I didn't want to speak to anyone.
6255661	eng	Tom said he's taught French before.
6255746	eng	I didn't get paid for doing that.
6255849	eng	Tom will probably tell Mary not to look out the window.
6255922	eng	Tom plays the drums and also sings.
6256029	eng	Tom said he doesn't think Mary ought to do that inside.
6256058	eng	You'll have a chance to do that.
6256108	eng	Tom isn't the only one who's tired.
6256152	eng	Tom probably doesn't know why Mary wants me to do that.
6256154	eng	You may get hurt if you do that.
6256243	eng	Tom is outside waiting in the rain.
6256249	eng	Tom is now learning how to do that.
6256344	eng	Tom told me that he's quicker at doing that than Mary.
6256411	eng	Tom intends to come back to Boston.
6256554	eng	Tom said he saw Mary waiting for the bus this morning.
6256699	eng	Tom has a wife and three daughters.
6256760	eng	I'd prefer not to do that today.
6256933	eng	Tom doesn't have time to get bored.
6257208	eng	Tom pretty much always does the same thing Mary does.
6257212	eng	Tom came to talk to me last Monday.
6257533	eng	Tom will do that for you, I think.
6257588	eng	I did that once with my friends.
6257609	eng	I can't tell you why I did that.
6257666	eng	How often do you use a computer?
6257790	eng	Tom probably doesn't know why Mary was ignoring him.
6257989	eng	Tom says he won't need to do that.
6258005	eng	You said you'd help me do that.
6258290	eng	That would be impossible to do.
6258445	eng	Tom often complains about his job.
6258483	eng	Tom doesn't think he can stop Mary from doing that.
6258509	eng	I'm still reluctant to do that.
6258567	eng	Tom didn't know whether Mary was having fun or not.
6258658	eng	Tom isn't likely to be tired.
6258698	eng	I want to get better at French.
6258740	eng	I think you should do that now.
6258779	eng	I signed a three-year contract.
6258851	eng	I need to get ready for school.
6259117	eng	I don't play with toys anymore.
6259475	eng	I can't find Boston on the map.
6259514	eng	Have you already paid the bill?
6259713	eng	Tom says he hopes Mary knows who to ask for help.
6259822	eng	Tom and I've gotten back together.
6259834	eng	Tom and I work very well together.
6259878	eng	Tom said Mary will probably still be cooperative.
6260029	eng	Tom finally managed to persuade Mary to help him.
6260074	eng	Tom didn't know whether Mary was swimming or not.
6260144	eng	Tom wasn't sure he could do that.
6260165	eng	Tom was the only person arrested.
6260206	eng	Tom wouldn't tell Mary why he wanted to do that.
6260254	eng	Tom was lying to Mary when he said he loved her.
6260285	eng	Tom thinks that we can't do that.
6260312	eng	Tom still does that every summer.
6260327	eng	Tom told Mary that he thought John was sensible.
6260385	eng	Tom should've been on that train.
6260452	eng	Tom says that doesn't bother him.
6260518	eng	Tom says he doesn't speak French.
6260803	eng	Tom really doesn't have a choice.
6260910	eng	Tom could do that for Mary if she wanted him to.
6261263	eng	I didn't want to sell my land.
6261415	eng	Tom is already retired, isn't he?
6261696	eng	Tom asked Mary why she needed to do that today.
6261783	eng	You'll ask Tom to do that for Mary, won't you?
6261995	eng	We'll do that again sometime.
6262040	eng	We can be in Boston all week.
6262091	eng	The captain wants to see you.
6262278	eng	Tom must've thought Mary was going to do that.
6262314	eng	Tom has already told Mary what she has to buy.
6262400	eng	Tom and I eventually got married.
6262484	eng	Tom agrees that this makes sense.
6262503	eng	I wonder if I should do that.
6262564	eng	I wasn't supposed to do that.
6262746	eng	Tom told me that he's terrified.
6262763	eng	Tom thinks Mary won't be hesitant to do that.
6263151	eng	Tom may be able to talk Mary into doing that.
6263437	eng	Does your room have a carpet?
6263472	eng	Tom is likely to be embarrassed.
6263575	eng	You've got to do that today.
6263577	eng	Tom hasn't done that in a while.
6263631	eng	Tom has never wanted to do that.
6263843	eng	Tom said Mary wasn't through doing that yet.
6263916	eng	Tom said Mary wanted him to do that for her.
6263940	eng	Tom said Mary knew he might want to do that.
6264033	eng	Tom is still determined to do that for Mary.
6264080	eng	My mother is also a teacher.
6264097	eng	Tom and I played miniature golf.
6264106	eng	Tom and I often help each other.
6264156	eng	Tom doesn't know why Mary doesn't like dogs.
6264188	eng	It's raining here in Boston.
6264192	eng	Tom didn't think Mary would need to do that.
6264256	eng	Tom would never try to do that.
6264273	eng	Tom could be faster at doing that than Mary.
6264279	eng	Tom asked Mary why she had to do that today.
6264496	eng	Tom spent the whole day hiking.
6264612	eng	Tom says Mary is thinking about doing that.
6264641	eng	I need to leave early today.
6264688	eng	Tom said he'll help us do that.
6264732	eng	Tom said Mary was likely to still be drunk.
6264820	eng	Tom regretted having done that.
6264864	eng	Tom said Mary didn't have anything to read.
6265035	eng	Tom doesn't know how Mary feels about that.
6265275	eng	Do you do that every Monday?
6265278	eng	Do you come to Boston often?
6265282	eng	Did you know that Tom saw you kissing Mary?
6265306	eng	Tom will be upset if Mary doesn't do that.
6265484	eng	Tom didn't want to go swimming.
6265799	eng	Tom always seems to be nervous.
6265821	eng	My house is well insulated.
6265948	eng	Tom didn't know that I was Mary's husband.
6266003	eng	Tom usually gets here on time.
6266122	eng	Tom would like to know how Mary did that.
6266189	eng	Tom should cancel the meeting.
6266211	eng	I should've told the truth.
6266280	eng	I need to apply for a visa.
6266401	eng	Tom said Mary would do that if she could.
6266419	eng	Tom said Mary was likely to be surprised.
6266588	eng	Tom is lucky to have survived.
6266648	eng	Tom is immune to that disease.
6267001	eng	Tom thought Mary was nervous doing that.
6267136	eng	Tom said that Mary needed to be careful.
6267217	eng	Tom said Mary was likely to be punctual.
6267398	eng	Tom urged me to study French.
6267554	eng	I've always loved history.
6267559	eng	Tom says he ought to do that.
6267567	eng	I didn't know Tom and Mary were an item.
6267705	eng	Tom thinks Mary won't do that for John.
6267776	eng	I waded across the stream.
6267780	eng	Tom says Mary is determined to do that.
6267812	eng	I shouldn't do that today.
6268013	eng	I heard three shots fired.
6268064	eng	I guess it's too late now.
6268137	eng	Tom is at least twice as heavy as Mary.
6268138	eng	Tom got fired for doing that.
6268214	eng	I didn't see anybody else.
6268621	eng	Tom will do that on his own.
6268667	eng	You look a little sleepy.
6269148	eng	Tom wondered where Mary wanted to go.
6269186	eng	I want to study medicine.
6269296	eng	Tom hasn't done that before.
6269419	eng	Tom doesn't seem to be here.
6269455	eng	Tom didn't sound optimistic.
6269737	eng	Tom wouldn't do that again.
6269755	eng	Tom won't likely be scared.
6269761	eng	Tom won't likely be afraid.
6269866	eng	Tom was a railway employee.
6269964	eng	Did you know Tom was Mary's grandson?
6270109	eng	Tom never did that with us.
6270136	eng	Tom must not do that again.
6270161	eng	This box is still empty.
6270475	eng	Tom finally found his keys.
6270536	eng	I should try to do that.
6270783	eng	Tom tried not to get in Mary's way.
6271056	eng	Did you break any rules?
6271174	eng	Tom doesn't care why Mary did that.
6271288	eng	I think Tom could do that for Mary.
6271390	eng	Tom told Mary what had to be done.
6271423	eng	Tom told Mary that he was furious.
6271425	eng	I'm too tired to study.
6271601	eng	Tom and I stopped kissing.
6271647	eng	I often work in Boston.
6271759	eng	Tom doesn't think Mary is jealous.
6271763	eng	Tom will likely be tired.
6271788	eng	I hate studying French.
6271908	eng	I didn't talk about it.
6271954	eng	Tom told Mary that he was sleepy.
6271984	eng	Tom told Mary John couldn't swim.
6272015	eng	Tom never let me give up.
6272039	eng	Tom may do what he wants.
6272194	eng	Tom said Mary could've done that.
6272222	eng	Tom has plans to do that.
6272293	eng	Tom didn't realize Mary had left.
6272312	eng	Tom did that all morning.
6272347	eng	Tom and Mary are still in Boston.
6272494	eng	Tom thought that Mary was tired.
6272496	eng	I won't do that today.
6272734	eng	Tom said Mary didn't want a job.
6272739	eng	I hope you'll say yes.
6272756	eng	Tom managed to run away.
6272905	eng	I didn't tell Tom Mary's secret.
6273058	eng	Tom thinks Mary should do that.
6273067	eng	Tom stabbed Mary with a dagger.
6273158	eng	Tom will still do that.
6273226	eng	Tom didn't think Mary was busy.
6273227	eng	Tom told us to do that.
6273258	eng	Tom and I want to talk to Mary.
6273376	eng	Tom must've been bored.
6273468	eng	Tom said Mary was embarrassed.
6273506	eng	I know it's too late.
6273518	eng	I had to leave early.
6273590	eng	I don't hunt anymore.
6273591	eng	Tom thought Mary wasn't cold.
6273766	eng	Tom said he's jealous.
6273831	eng	Tom has told Mary to do that.
6273982	eng	Tom did that ages ago.
6274100	eng	Here's the solution.
6274156	eng	Tom said he's afraid.
6274346	eng	I work at a bakery.
6274348	eng	Tom and I have a son.
6274446	eng	Tom said Mary wasn't done.
6274715	eng	I don't like golf.
6274716	eng	Tom and Mary are wealthy.
6274736	eng	I can't stand you.
6274751	eng	How late were you?
6274848	eng	It's impressive.
6274854	eng	I'm reading now.
6276661	eng	You will think something else completely, when you see her.
6284125	eng	It's a custom job.
6284904	eng	He quickly became my best friend.
6285041	eng	Tom has a home theater.
6285429	eng	Scientists believe that asteroids are the leftover building blocks of our solar system planets.
6288476	eng	I was apt to write novels.
6289354	eng	Sometimes he was desolate and innocent, but sometimes gracious and flamboyant. I couldn't know his all sides yet.
6291193	eng	You drive me crazy with your persistent nagging.
6292120	eng	Some cruise ships throw their trash directly into the sea.
6292155	eng	Thank you. I really appreciate it.
6293543	eng	How is this airline?
6293943	eng	Katrina, however, cannot compare to a colossal hurricane on Saturn.
6293962	eng	Volcanoes on other solar system planets are much larger and much more active than those on Earth.
6297909	eng	"Is this Chinese or Japanese?" "It's Korean."
6298164	eng	The interior of the house corresponds to its pleasant exterior.
6299017	eng	Tom is Mary's stepbrother.
6301678	eng	His very person and appearance were such as to strike the attention of the most casual observer.
6301681	eng	His thin, hawk-like nose gave his whole expression an air of alertness and decision.
6301698	eng	You say that we go round the sun. If we went round the moon it would not make a pennyworth of difference to me or to my work.
6302313	eng	Sami married at twenty five.
6303577	eng	Stop messing around and get ready for school.
6303832	eng	I have seen death in many forms, but never has it appeared to me in a more fearsome aspect than in that dark, grimy apartment, which looked out upon one of the main arteries of suburban London.
6307748	eng	Zeus fell in love not only with beautiful women, but also with good-looking men.
6308091	eng	Sami took cover behind his car.
6308691	eng	That was, without doubt, their weakest match this year.
6309954	eng	The Vehmic courts were abolished in 1811 by order of Jérôme Bonaparte, king of Westphalia.
6310020	eng	Will you have some whiskey and water?
6310151	eng	The dog's laboured breathing and glazing eye showed that it was not far from its end. Indeed, its snow-white muzzle proclaimed that it had already exceeded the usual term of canine existence.
6310283	eng	The boat tipped over and everyone fell into the water.
6310316	eng	Mary was the most beautiful girl in the village.
6310899	eng	The watchers from the plain below could see them flit from rock to rock until their figures stood out against the skyline.
6311217	eng	Mission accomplished, general.
6312316	eng	If Tom did not kill Mary, then who did?
6321757	eng	A band of rain, heading eastwards, will reach all parts by the end of the day.
6322091	eng	Tom, could you explain to me what a quark is?
6322170	eng	No pain will last forever.
6323049	eng	Have you sat down with him and talked?
6327269	eng	Tom likes folk music.
6327565	eng	When Sami goes home, he goes straight to his computer.
6328566	eng	This medicine will allay the pain.
6329228	eng	The electricity got turned off because Tom forgot to pay the electricity bill.
6329324	eng	Sami encountered a familiar face.
6330640	eng	When will you advance?
6330758	eng	I have a stepmother.
6330959	eng	Sami slowly opened the zipper.
6331122	eng	The female bear fled with her cubs.
6333869	eng	I admit to having killed him.
6334608	eng	You don't seem willing to do that.
6334622	eng	You ought to tell Tom that you aren't planning on staying very long.
6334666	eng	You didn't know who Tom was planning to go with, did you?
6334804	eng	We're not the only ones doing that.
6334809	eng	Both of us will do that tomorrow.
6334812	eng	We were unable to help Tom do that.
6334835	eng	We both have to do that again.
6335041	eng	Tom says he's planning on going to Boston with Mary.
6335158	eng	Tom said he plans to stay with us for a couple of weeks.
6335229	eng	Tom plans on leaving Boston next year.
6335531	eng	Tom and Mary are planning on staying until Monday.
6335543	eng	Tom and I are planning to travel together.
6335631	eng	OK, I won't do that again.
6335649	eng	No one thinks you're the one who did that.
6335863	eng	I'm planning on doing that tomorrow.
6335949	eng	I'd have shown you how to do that if you'd asked me to.
6336031	eng	I'd have been late if Tom hadn't given me a ride.
6336187	eng	I wonder whether Tom's parents will allow him to go with us.
6336216	eng	I wonder whether Tom would help me with my homework.
6336556	eng	I wonder whether Tom really said that.
6336617	eng	I wonder if Tom really forgot to tell Mary what to do.
6336654	eng	I wonder whether Tom realizes how long it'll take to do that.
6336693	eng	I wonder whether Tom knows that Mary can't do that.
6336695	eng	I wonder whether Tom knows Mary.
6337276	eng	I wonder whether I should go or not.
6337332	eng	I wonder whether I can learn how to do that in three hours.
6337334	eng	I wonder whether I can do that again.
6337546	eng	I knew Tom wasn't planning on doing that.
6337550	eng	I imagine that's how I'd do that.
6337583	eng	I haven't talked to the manager yet.
6337587	eng	I haven't ruled out doing that yet.
6337734	eng	I wasn't able to open the door.
6337848	eng	Everybody knew Tom was the one who did that.
6337876	eng	Does anyone still do that?
6337940	eng	Can you do that alone?
6338233	eng	It won't be any fun unless Tom goes swimming with us.
6338254	eng	I'm pretty sure Tom didn't drink any beer last night.
6338565	eng	I wonder who'll tell Tom that he shouldn't be doing that.
6338657	eng	I'd rather stay here than go to Boston with Tom.
6338668	eng	I think I won't need to ask Tom to help me do that.
6338879	eng	Tom said he was going to go to Boston and see if he could find a job there.
6338996	eng	Tom told me that he doesn't have those kinds of problems anymore.
6339158	eng	Tom said he thought that I was the right person for the job.
6339215	eng	Tom told me he had a daughter he'd like to introduce me to.
6339571	eng	I regret that I wasn't as careful as I should've been.
6339661	eng	I thought you said we weren't going to do that again.
6339677	eng	Tom said he was pretty sure that you wouldn't do that.
6339840	eng	I've already told Tom he has to leave early.
6340035	eng	I don't know why Tom does that, but he does.
6340103	eng	Tom seemed to be a lot happier after you showed up.
6340167	eng	Please don't let Tom do anything dangerous.
6340219	eng	You're already old enough to do that by yourself.
6340368	eng	Tom is the only person I know here who can't swim.
6340388	eng	I don't think I'll be allowed to do that anymore.
6340604	eng	I think I'll come here every Monday from now on.
6340748	eng	Where are you going to live after you graduate?
6340777	eng	I haven't yet met either of Tom's sisters.
6340850	eng	I thought you were going to be able to do that.
6341111	eng	I wasn't able to buy enough food for everyone.
6341227	eng	I don't think Tom knows when it happened.
6341356	eng	Why does Tom usually do that by himself?
6341561	eng	I believe that we can take care of ourselves.
6341613	eng	Tom didn't seem to like talking about himself.
6341684	eng	Why didn't you do that the way I showed you?
6342017	eng	Whether you go or not doesn't matter to me.
6342121	eng	I think that Tom will agree to do that.
6342195	eng	Tom said he wouldn't show me how to do that.
6342582	eng	I'm not sure what Tom wants me to buy.
6342630	eng	I wonder why Tom is being so stubborn.
6342684	eng	I was surprised when Tom told me that.
6343190	eng	Tom is the only other person who did that.
6343325	eng	I didn't know you didn't need to do that.
6343669	eng	Do you think Tom is still interested?
6343719	eng	Tom is the only one who knew where I was.
6343931	eng	I can't just leave you here by yourself.
6344063	eng	I wonder if Tom is still dependable.
6344095	eng	Tom said he wasn't on the baseball team.
6344277	eng	I don't think Tom would let you win.
6344397	eng	Have you ever played music with Tom?
6344590	eng	Are you still looking for a babysitter?
6344643	eng	I'm pretty sure that Tom won't win.
6344875	eng	I knew Tom wasn't ready to do that.
6344878	eng	I knew Tom wasn't happy about this.
6344883	eng	Tom didn't do that entirely on his own.
6344917	eng	I heard that Tom has been arrested.
6344938	eng	I had no idea Tom wouldn't do that.
6345023	eng	I now know why I should've left early.
6345095	eng	I don't think you're ready to do that.
6345176	eng	How much time will it take to do that?
6345260	eng	You think that we can win, don't you?
6345291	eng	Tom read his book report to the class.
6345322	eng	I'm not sure how Tom will do that.
6345681	eng	Tom was the one who did that for you.
6345831	eng	Tom seemed reluctant to say anything.
6345906	eng	Tom said I should ask you to do that.
6345936	eng	Tom probably went cycling by himself.
6346006	eng	It's quite possible Tom will win.
6346223	eng	It took me quite a while to do that.
6346231	eng	I think Tom wants you to do that.
6346357	eng	I haven't told Tom who helped me.
6346458	eng	I speak French fairly well, I think.
6346509	eng	Do you think Tom will really win?
6346575	eng	Do you really think Tom is wrong?
6346593	eng	Do you really think Tom is funny?
6346605	eng	Do you really think Tom is bored?
6346778	eng	Tom is likely to still be miserable.
6346859	eng	Tom didn't want to do that that way.
6346973	eng	Tom and I already know you did that.
6347091	eng	I knew Tom wasn't going to talk.
6347231	eng	Tom says he'll go there by himself.
6347285	eng	Tom said he didn't want to eat now.
6347311	eng	I don't intend to buy that for you.
6347359	eng	I definitely won't do that anymore.
6347434	eng	Don't leave until you've done that.
6347622	eng	I wasn't sure why Tom was late.
6347681	eng	Tom wouldn't have done any better.
6347891	eng	Tom told all his friends the news.
6347903	eng	Tom suggested that we go swimming.
6347971	eng	I think I'd like to eat right now.
6348164	eng	Tom is the only adult in the room.
6348201	eng	I might go to Boston with Tom.
6348249	eng	I hope Tom isn't still crying.
6348265	eng	Aren't you glad we didn't do that?
6348410	eng	Tom won't tell me how to do that.
6348447	eng	Would Tom really sing for us?
6348484	eng	There's an easier way to do that.
6348531	eng	Tom told me to do that, so I did.
6348547	eng	It looks like Tom is nervous.
6348636	eng	Tom seemed to find that annoying.
6348714	eng	Tom said he may agree to do that.
6348891	eng	I haven't paid for my ticket yet.
6348966	eng	I didn't know this was your seat.
6349049	eng	It's Tom that I want to see.
6349101	eng	All the windows have been closed.
6349479	eng	Why wouldn't Tom stay here?
6349559	eng	Tom seemed to be very motivated.
6349572	eng	Perhaps Tom didn't do that.
6349667	eng	I may have to wait a bit longer.
6349731	eng	Tom looks like he's embarrassed.
6349774	eng	I expect that Tom will win.
6350027	eng	You look like you're impressed.
6350077	eng	I think Tom might not win.
6350150	eng	We don't want to do that again.
6350163	eng	Tom was scolded by the teacher.
6350264	eng	It looks like you're impressed.
6350286	eng	Tom told me he liked the movie.
6350413	eng	I doubt that Tom can win.
6350448	eng	Tom never really wanted to win.
6350469	eng	Tom may have agreed to do that.
6350738	eng	I bought this at a thrift shop.
6350975	eng	What did Tom find out?
6351003	eng	Where did you put the car key?
6351007	eng	Tom told me he won't marry me.
6351333	eng	I went skating yesterday, too.
6351612	eng	Does Tom like jazz?
6351896	eng	You look like you're wealthy.
6352008	eng	Tom seemed to be comfortable.
6352031	eng	We can't get back home today.
6352247	eng	I went there to learn French.
6352353	eng	Tom didn't seem disappointed.
6352437	eng	Tom will get mad if you win.
6352477	eng	Tom wasn't the only witness.
6352611	eng	I can't believe you said yes.
6352664	eng	Tom isn't the one who convinced Mary to stop doing that.
6352882	eng	Tom looks like he's worried.
6352984	eng	Tom isn't looking for a job.
6353005	eng	Tom is very sure he can win.
6353230	eng	Tom became a French teacher.
6353264	eng	I don't think Tom knows when Mary will visit Boston.
6353298	eng	I didn't know you'd do that.
6353647	eng	Tom says that he can't win.
6353651	eng	I don't think Tom knows why Mary wants to do that.
6353824	eng	Tom is probably eating now.
6353875	eng	Tom had no trouble winning.
6354037	eng	Tom wasn't very confident.
6354108	eng	You know we can't do that.
6354157	eng	Tom told me he left early.
6354174	eng	What did you use for bait?
6354307	eng	Tom says he wants to swim.
6354611	eng	Tom and Mary could've done that by themselves.
6354614	eng	Tom and Mary aren't planning to sing together.
6354778	eng	Tom was very sympathetic.
6354853	eng	Tom told me he should go.
6355082	eng	Is this book interesting?
6355086	eng	Tom isn't wearing a suit.
6355332	eng	Tom wasn't yet finished.
6355383	eng	Tom wasn't bothering me.
6355687	eng	Tom told Mary he wasn't going to do that.
6355762	eng	Tom and Mary need to do that immediately.
6355809	eng	Tom had to do that, too.
6355861	eng	Tom didn't seem jealous.
6356024	eng	I wasn't surprised to see Tom with Mary.
6356092	eng	Tom thought Mary had agreed to do that.
6356139	eng	We could do that today.
6356150	eng	Tom doesn't want Mary to do that again.
6356178	eng	Please wash this shirt.
6356370	eng	I heard you doing that.
6356528	eng	Tom said he knew that Mary would win.
6356744	eng	Tom told Mary that he wanted to win.
6356829	eng	I didn't buy that car.
6356984	eng	Tom said Mary would likely not win.
6357037	eng	We actually did that.
6357226	eng	Tom wasn't suspended.
6357385	eng	Tom seemed disturbed.
6357573	eng	I hope you can swim.
6357580	eng	Tom didn't talk much.
6357667	eng	Tom wasn't upstairs.
6357740	eng	Tom seems irritated.
6357805	eng	Tom said he wanted Mary to win.
6357865	eng	Tom begged Mary to stay longer.
6357902	eng	Are you still open?
6358006	eng	Tom and Mary are still crying.
6358012	eng	Tom admitted he despised Mary.
6358100	eng	Do I have to swim?
6358171	eng	Maybe Tom asked Mary to do that.
6358223	eng	I did that wrong.
6358244	eng	Did you buy much?
6358260	eng	Tom was a soldier.
6358513	eng	Tom said Mary left early.
6358636	eng	Tom won't let Mary win.
6358907	eng	DNA doesn't lie.
6361534	eng	The comfort zone is a psychological state in which one feels familiar, safe, at ease, and secure.
6361967	eng	Everything you want is just outside your comfort zone.
6365529	eng	Sami did it purely for fun.
6365767	eng	I'll be the last to take a bath.
6366765	eng	St. Patrick is the patron saint of Ireland.
6371970	eng	What's the best solution?
6372046	eng	Tom has a terrible cold and croaks like a raven.
6374196	eng	Think about what you're going to do.
6374320	eng	Sami didn't deserve to die like that.
6374324	eng	Sami was sleeping like a baby.
6375322	eng	Sami moved to Toronto, Ontario.
6375351	eng	We have called child protective services.
6375610	eng	This isn't the proper place for this.
6375734	eng	Have you forgotten who Sami is?
6375839	eng	Sami is gonna be OK.
6376014	eng	You'll have to lend me some of your clothes.
6376333	eng	Layla kept her home like a model home.
6376514	eng	How sweet you are, darling.
6376523	eng	If this affair is discovered, Sami is going to have a tremendous problem.
6376564	eng	Sami took Layla by the hand.
6376614	eng	I accept the case for the inheritance claim.
6376728	eng	If Sami dares to come near Layla, I'll break him in half.
6376834	eng	Sami is my guest and he's staying to have dinner with us.
6377472	eng	You have a leaf in your hair.
6377767	eng	The Milky Way galaxy is bound in a cluster of about thirty-five galaxies.
6377930	eng	Please tell us about yourself.
6378628	eng	Sami didn't divorce Layla.
6378721	eng	Sami used Layla's money to buy a home.
6379022	eng	Sami was out of his mind.
6381788	eng	Tom kissed Mary on the way home from the dance.
6382687	eng	They are living in another house.
6382697	eng	Why didn't he message me?
6382931	eng	Who could be knocking at the door at this time of night?
6383645	eng	Passive houses don't require any active cooling or heating.
6383699	eng	He told me that he loved me and I told him that I loved him too.
6384509	eng	The dyke was repaired and the seawater was pumped out.
6385626	eng	Sami said he was a nobody.
6385750	eng	Sami got sick and died.
6385859	eng	Sami was too blind to appreciate Layla.
6388057	eng	Are you going by bus or by train?
6389255	eng	I like Tom too.
6393116	eng	I cannot travel to Boston as long as the visa ban is in effect.
6394275	eng	I took a break and I feel better.
6396698	eng	Sami managed to speak to the boss.
6396728	eng	Sami wanted Layla to be honest with him.
6396732	eng	Sami worked for the ministry of health.
6399849	eng	Mythology is a dictionary of living hieroglyphics.
6402457	eng	Tom was the only one not wearing a costume.
6403210	eng	This house is a fabulous example of Victorian Gothic architecture.
6403294	eng	It's all starting to make sense now.
6404289	eng	Tom said Mary seemed reluctant to eat what he had cooked for her.
6405287	eng	The young witch was casting a spell, when Tom rushed towards her, grabbed her, and interrupted the ritual with a passionate kiss on her mouth.
6405570	eng	Sami is the one who caused all the trouble at the clinic.
6406497	eng	Mary said she didn't plan on doing that.
6406582	eng	Mary said she wasn't planning on going to Tom and Alice's wedding.
6406662	eng	Mary says she isn't planning on going tomorrow.
6406663	eng	Mary says she isn't planning to go tomorrow.
6406714	eng	Mary told me where she was planning on staying.
6406833	eng	Mary realized she barely had enough time to do everything that needed to be done.
6406922	eng	Mary said she thought Tom needed at least $300 to buy everything he needed.
6406986	eng	Mary could've gone camping with you if you'd let her know you were going.
6407047	eng	Mary said that she was planning to eat the whole watermelon by herself.
6407147	eng	After Mary explained it in French, she said the same thing in English.
6407247	eng	Mary probably doesn't yet know how much time she'll have to do that.
6407288	eng	You seemed surprised when Mary told you she didn't need to do that.
6407637	eng	Mary should probably not tell Tom she doesn't intend to do that.
6407677	eng	Mary might possibly have studied French when she was in college.
6407688	eng	Mary is doing that because it's what she thinks she needs to do.
6407703	eng	I'm not going to be the one who tells Mary what she needs to do.
6408108	eng	Mary told Tom that she thought John was doing that right now.
6408173	eng	Tom got three weeks' detention.
6408269	eng	I thought Mary was finished, but she told me that she wasn't.
6408429	eng	Mary said she has something she wanted to do this afternoon.
6408584	eng	Mary wanted to do that by herself, but I begged her not to.
6408629	eng	Mary said she'd appreciate it if you could do that for her.
6408632	eng	Mary said she wished she hadn't forgotten to lock the door.
6408665	eng	Mary said she hoped Tom got home before it started raining.
6408791	eng	How do you know Mary didn't do what she was supposed to do?
6408894	eng	Mary says she didn't know Tom needed to help John do that.
6408928	eng	Mary said she thought she might have to do that this week.
6408944	eng	Mary said she needed at least $300 to buy what she needed.
6408986	eng	Mary needs to be more careful the next time she does that.
6409006	eng	Mary is likely going to be very hungry when she gets home.
6409069	eng	I'm the one who told Mary that she needed to study French.
6409169	eng	Mary told me that she thought Tom had been irresponsible.
6409184	eng	Mary told Tom that she was glad that he'd come to Boston.
6409275	eng	Mary said she'd had nothing to do with what had happened.
6409283	eng	Mary said she wasn't going to go shopping this afternoon.
6409327	eng	Mary said she didn't think Tom really enjoyed doing that.
6409397	eng	Mary doesn't know what happened because she wasn't there.
6409405	eng	Mary didn't understand exactly what Tom wanted her to do.
6409455	eng	If Mary isn't careful, she's going to get herself killed.
6409567	eng	Mary wanted to kiss Tom goodbye, but knew she shouldn't.
6409621	eng	Mary says she thinks it might be interesting to do that.
6409934	eng	Mary took something from her pocket and gave it to Tom.
6409980	eng	Mary should probably tell Tom what she wants him to do.
6410087	eng	Mary said she didn't really expect anyone to volunteer.
6410131	eng	Mary is probably going to be hungry when she gets home.
6410272	eng	Ask Mary if she has enough money to buy what she needs.
6410565	eng	Mary lied to Tom when she told him she wasn't married.
6410591	eng	Mary is going to be very glad that she didn't do that.
6410670	eng	Mary confessed that she was the one who had done that.
6410682	eng	Mary admitted she was the one who ate all the cookies.
6410756	eng	Do you think Mary would do that if she had the chance?
6410797	eng	Mary would've come to Boston with us if she could've.
6410811	eng	Mary went back to school to get something she forgot.
6411086	eng	Mary made herself a peanut butter sandwich for lunch.
6411171	eng	Mary did something she didn't want Tom to know about.
6411282	eng	What do you think Mary did with the money she stole?
6411311	eng	Mary wondered how much time she'd have to eat lunch.
6411355	eng	Mary told me she thought it would be fun to do that.
6411470	eng	Mary said she'd probably do that on Monday with Tom.
6411486	eng	Mary said she wished she hadn't gone there with Tom.
6411507	eng	Mary said she thought it would be raining on Monday.
6411579	eng	Mary said she could probably do that in three hours.
6411662	eng	Mary has been told that she doesn't need to do that.
6411777	eng	I told Mary I wanted her to teach me how to do that.
6411874	eng	Mary would've done that by herself if she could've.
6412010	eng	Mary still doesn't think Tom can do that, does she?
6412089	eng	Mary said she'd try to do that as soon as possible.
6412100	eng	Mary said she wasn't going Tom and Alice's wedding.
6412176	eng	Mary said she I thought I should do that by myself.
6412460	eng	Yesterday, Mary told me she couldn't speak French.
6412539	eng	Mary told me that she'll be in Boston next Monday.
6412576	eng	Mary told Tom that she thought John was incorrect.
6412684	eng	Mary said that she thought Boston was a safe city.
6412955	eng	Mary deleted all of Tom's pictures from her phone.
6412996	eng	If Mary's not careful, she's going to get injured.
6413035	eng	I should've never let Mary go swimming by herself.
6413142	eng	Mary wasn't convinced that she needed to do that.
6413167	eng	Mary told me to meet her in front of the theater.
6413218	eng	Mary told Tom that she thought John was upstairs.
6413456	eng	Mary said she didn't have any idea where Tom was.
6413673	eng	It's entirely up to Mary whether she goes or not.
6413698	eng	I think we shouldn't let Mary do that by herself.
6413910	eng	Mary told Tom that she thought John was nervous.
6414007	eng	Mary said they wouldn't let her do that anymore.
6414285	eng	Mary doesn't know she shouldn't do that anymore.
6414385	eng	I don't think Mary knows what she should do yet.
6414414	eng	Ask Mary if she has anybody to help her do that.
6414485	eng	Mary was probably very tired when she got home.
6414609	eng	Mary says she expects Tom to be back on Monday.
6414616	eng	Mary says she doesn't think Tom had to do that.
6414765	eng	Mary never told me she wanted to go to Harvard.
6414814	eng	Mary isn't as crazy as everybody thinks she is.
6414908	eng	Mary doesn't come here as often as she used to.
6415058	eng	Ask Mary whether she's going to do that or not.
6415100	eng	Mary's friends asked her to come out and play.
6415138	eng	Mary went back to where she'd met Tom earlier.
6415254	eng	Mary told Tom that she thought John was awake.
6415275	eng	Mary talked Tom into going to Boston with her.
6415301	eng	Mary says that she'd like to do that with you.
6415318	eng	Mary says she thinks it's possible to do that.
6415582	eng	Mary likes to do almost everything by herself.
6415672	eng	Mary had enough time to do what she had to do.
6415697	eng	Mary doesn't play golf as much as she used to.
6415841	eng	I just hope Mary does what we asked her to do.
6415889	eng	Tell Mary I'm looking forward to meeting her.
6415929	eng	Mary will probably tell Tom she isn't hungry.
6415955	eng	Mary was much taller than I thought she'd be.
6416001	eng	Mary told me that she thought Tom was guilty.
6416107	eng	Mary says she knows Tom will have to do that.
6416157	eng	Mary said she's very sure Tom has to do that.
6416332	eng	Mary never told anyone where she hid the key.
6416383	eng	Mary knew I'd do whatever she asked me to do.
6416454	eng	Mary has a car, but she almost never uses it.
6416724	eng	Mary wanted me to buy some firewood for her.
6416932	eng	Mary said she wasn't sure she could do that.
6417073	eng	Mary made it clear that she wanted to leave.
6417220	eng	Mary doesn't do that as much as she used to.
6417294	eng	Mary can be persuasive when she wants to be.
6417399	eng	Did Mary know we didn't want her to do that?
6417520	eng	Mary told me that she thought Tom was lost.
6417719	eng	Mary said she'd be the last one to do that.
6417907	eng	Mary just told me she was getting divorced.
6418015	eng	Mary doesn't think I can do that, does she?
6418021	eng	Mary doesn't really believe that, does she?
6418103	eng	Mary can't go out today because she's sick.
6418187	eng	Have you ever asked Mary why she does that?
6418280	eng	Mary wasn't as busy as I thought she'd be.
6418444	eng	Mary said that she wouldn't swim tomorrow.
6418501	eng	Mary said she wished Tom wouldn't do that.
6418612	eng	Mary remembered where she'd last seen Tom.
6418706	eng	Mary is lucky she's still able to do that.
6418736	eng	Mary has no idea what she's talking about.
6418749	eng	Mary has a lot of things she wants to buy.
6419139	eng	Mary should have someone do that for her.
6419253	eng	Mary said she'd be able to help us today.
6419514	eng	Mary is a lot older than she says she is.
6419569	eng	Mary doesn't want to go there by herself.
6419623	eng	Mary did everything Tom needed her to do.
6419715	eng	I think Mary lied about how she did that.
6419813	eng	Mary will help whoever asks her to help.
6419921	eng	Mary thought she didn't need to do that.

6430273	eng	Tom thought Mary was unlikely to do that.
6430325	eng	Tom said that Mary wouldn't like to do that.
6430374	eng	Tom said he might walk to work tomorrow.
6430395	eng	Tom needs to do everything they tell him to do.
6430435	eng	Tom might be lying.
6430508	eng	Tom has been very nice to everybody.
6430857	eng	I think that both Tom and Mary want to do that.
6430876	eng	I think Tom and Mary have both given up hope.
6430934	eng	I may need to tell Tom about that.

6431988	eng	Tom says he needs the rest of the money you owe him.
6432018	eng	Tom is probably going to be tired when he gets home.
6432371	eng	I wonder why Tom lied to us about where he'd been.
6432414	eng	Tom told Mary he wanted to go to Boston with her.
6432502	eng	Tom has been in the hospital for three weeks now.
6432592	eng	Tom will be waiting for Mary in the parking lot.

6433458	eng	Tom and Mary got married on October 20, 2013.
6433514	eng	How many times a day do you check your email?
6433783	eng	I thought Tom would apologize, but he didn't.

6434323	eng	Tom has been waiting for Mary to call him.
6434590	eng	Tom lives in a middle-class neighborhood.
6434640	eng	Tom is going to find out sooner or later.
6434658	eng	Tom is going to be able to come tomorrow.
6434744	eng	I hope Tom will like what I made for him.
6435059	eng	Neither Tom nor Mary has to do that now.
6435072	eng	It's probably not going to happen today.
6435109	eng	I hope Tom doesn't find out what we did.
6435173	eng	Tom won't let us go there without Mary.
6435177	eng	Tom will likely lose everything he has.
6435447	eng	I have only one friend who likes opera.

6436451	eng	Has Tom ever asked you to help Mary?

6437132	eng	It didn't take us long to do that.
6437237	eng	Tom will come after us, won't he?
6437282	eng	Tom said that he wasn't offended.
6437404	eng	Tom is likely going to be lonely.
6437551	eng	I know both Mary and her husband.
6437555	eng	I joined the team just yesterday.
6437623	eng	Tom's parents are Mary and John.

6438073	eng	Are these Tom's and Mary's cups?
6438107	eng	Tom won't likely help us today.
6438119	eng	Tom will come back and help us.
6438254	eng	Tom is very busy at the moment.
6438329	eng	Tom and Mary are still at home.

6439265	eng	I know Tom won't lie to you.
6439401	eng	Tom said that Mary was ill.
6439640	eng	Tom needs to go with Mary.
6439647	eng	Tom knows we believe Mary.

6448161	eng	Sami has done nothing.
6448213	eng	Sami has grown so much.
6448284	eng	Sami will take Layla to the airport.

6448395	eng	Sami thought something had happened to Layla.
6448413	eng	Sami searched for Layla in every single room of that house.
6451233	eng	Sami tried to drown Layla.
6451360	eng	Sami was surrounded by girls who were staring at him.
6453866	eng	Everybody is in their little silo and completely clueless.
6454748	eng	The farther I went, the deeper my car sank in the mud.
6456393	eng	Hold me tight.
6456579	eng	Sami tried one of the cookies.

6465909	eng	You laugh too much!
6468253	eng	Is this an issue?
6468669	eng	What the hell is a juice box?
6469279	eng	Sami changed the script.
6470277	eng	According to the internet, extraordinary things are thought to be interesting.
6474485	eng	Sami heard a resounding yes from the crowd.

6474683	eng	Sami talked about Layla all the time.

6492455	eng	I told Tom and Mary it would be dangerous to do that, but they still wanted to do it.
6492575	eng	I suppose since Tom and Mary don't have any money, they won't be able to do that.
6492595	eng	Tom and Mary said they wanted to make sure John knew what he was supposed to do.
6492628	eng	If Tom and Mary had been speaking French, I'd have been able to understand them.

6539698	eng	Sami seems to be loving every minute of it.
6540156	eng	Are you guys sure that's necessary?
6542936	eng	Stay here with me. You'll be safe.
6545240	eng	Tom's question took me by surprise.
6549788	eng	Looks like it’s your lucky day.
6549886	eng	Watch out for landmines.
6551424	eng	My brother's son is my nephew.
6554578	eng	I told Tom about my dream.
6555498	eng	Mary doesn't realise that she gets on everyone's wick.
6556102	eng	Of course, Tom missed his father.
6558439	eng	In the Mediterranean forests, we have many kinds of trees: oak, pine, willow, ash, elm, and others.
6558835	eng	Is that why you stopped?
6560143	eng	Sami denied ever beating Layla.
6561174	eng	We won a victory for Palestine here tonight.
6566244	eng	At the end of the game, the player with the most points wins.
6566264	eng	Sami got a call from police.
6566970	eng	You're a scallywag!
6567102	eng	Sami eulogized the man he murdered.
6567138	eng	Sami was loving and caring about other people.
6567219	eng	Sami is telling his version of the story.
6567957	eng	Sami acted like a thug.
6567976	eng	Sami lost weight.

6568734	eng	Tom did a bang-up job.
6569060	eng	Tom ran away from the policemen.
6569079	eng	Tom put the binoculars in his bag.
6570023	eng	Sami gave Layla the finger and she gave him the finger back.
6570821	eng	Point your toes.
6572300	eng	Mary thinks you're made for each other.
6573572	eng	Why don't you come by my place tonight?
6574147	eng	This is not your father's police state.
6574156	eng	The Chinese are said to detest French baguettes because they're compared to dog bones.
6574930	eng	Sami confirmed Layla's account.
6575062	eng	Sami knew in his heart that he was right.
6575179	eng	What smells funky?
6575254	eng	Where is my bag?
6575328	eng	Sami heard a gun going off.
6575456	eng	So it goes.
6575513	eng	She died in her sleep.
6575658	eng	You fell asleep with your glasses on.
6575743	eng	It was old hat.
6575912	eng	I don't understand their culture.
6576163	eng	Sami found Layla in a fast-food parking lot.
6576474	eng	I am not asking.
6576494	eng	I won't be home for long.
6576695	eng	Sit up straight!
6576798	eng	It's so cold.
6577073	eng	Can you alphabetize these quickly?
6577077	eng	I'm sliding.
6577086	eng	He's still got a broken heart.
6577129	eng	I'm not sure I can descend from there.
6577130	eng	Watch how he scrambles up the hillside.
6577349	eng	He never called back.
6577616	eng	Sami was still lying, bleeding from a gunshot wound.
6577692	eng	Sami and Layla had a lot in common.
6577697	eng	Sami had a hard time making eye contact with Layla.
6579089	eng	Mary sat down at the desk and began to write.
6579304	eng	Today, I do not have housework to do.
6579437	eng	The path winds along the road.
6580400	eng	Mary had everything a girl could ever want.
6580496	eng	Watch the movie and be quiet!
6581015	eng	I am fully convinced.
6581040	eng	If you doubt what you see, how can you say what you say?
6581206	eng	You miss.
6582556	eng	The doctor has no office hours on Monday morning.
6582628	eng	The game console beckons me.
6583454	eng	Wash your hands after using the restroom.
6583702	eng	"My liver, my business. Case closed," said Tom.
6583803	eng	Why should they suffer?
6585130	eng	I saw the way you two were looking at each other.
6585136	eng	Things have been a little hectic lately.
6586466	eng	Is this how you want to be remembered? Eating cheese doodles and watching Matlock?
6586543	eng	After she ordered 3 large pepperoni pizzas, her dorm mates put her on suicide watch.
6586585	eng	Nice. Now I can relax instead of studying for that test.
6586700	eng	If completed.
6587098	eng	The beat goes on.
6588382	eng	I'm not feeling well at all.
6589096	eng	He has a good character.
6589171	eng	The police officer crashed his motorcycle.
6592626	eng	I have nothing against humans.

6604276	eng	Take seasickness medication at least an hour before you board.
6606844	eng	"There must be a logical explanation for it." "Not everything can be explained through logic, my dear Tom."
6607823	eng	Daisuke failed to solve the problem, whereas Aiko succeeded in solving the problem.
6608053	eng	Yes, it's very funny.
6610448	eng	Can you pick me up?
6611142	eng	At the gym, Tom's heartbeat rises dramatically when he thinks about future social interactions.
6611829	eng	I don't usually get enough sleep.
6614564	eng	Do you hike?
6616299	eng	Speak your point.
6616818	eng	Tom asked his guidance counsellor how to apply to college.
6616834	eng	Tom asked us to turn the music down.
6617314	eng	Tom will likely testify against you.
6620803	eng	"What is it, then — a fire?" "No; a client. It seems that a young lady has arrived in a considerable state of excitement, who insists upon seeing me."
6622176	eng	All the other teenagers have nice cars.
6622806	eng	You had gone to Italy to see the king's son.
6627007	eng	What jerks!
6627474	eng	It's a very interesting brochure.

6655680	eng	You've changed so much that I didn't recognize you at first.
6655800	eng	I wasn't able to stay as long as I thought I'd be able to.
6655953	eng	It'll take me at least three weeks to finish doing this.
6656087	eng	Tom didn't take anything.
6656097	eng	I don't like having to admit that I can't do something.

6656960	eng	I don't have all the tools I need to do that job.
6657089	eng	I got to school earlier than usual this morning.
6657123	eng	You don't seem to mind that Tom is doing that.
6657254	eng	I can't quite believe that Tom really did that.
6657327	eng	I don't think Tom can do that that soon.
6657401	eng	I don't believe Tom would do that by himself.
6657499	eng	Tom drowned his neighbor's cat.
6657531	eng	I'll be late for the meeting if I don't hurry.
6657596	eng	Tom got very distracted.

6658012	eng	I visited Tom when I was in Boston.
6658141	eng	I won't do everything you've asked me to do.
6658222	eng	I got back in my car and started the engine.

6658359	eng	Tom isn't outside, but Mary is.
6658467	eng	Tom said he felt woozy.
6658488	eng	Tom doesn't want Mary to come here.
6658548	eng	Tom packed a suitcase and left.
6658595	eng	I don't do that as often as I wish I could.
6658679	eng	Tom shouldn't do anything else.
6658765	eng	I'm going to do whatever you ask me to do.
6658934	eng	Tom is nosey, but Mary isn't.
6659093	eng	I don't think Tom will be in Boston next winter.
6659165	eng	I should've advised Tom not to agree to do that.
6659442	eng	Let's see if Tom would like to do that.
6659472	eng	I often argue with Tom.
6659515	eng	I'm going to have the chance to do that.
6659569	eng	I'll have this done before you get back.
6659676	eng	Which guitar is Tom's?
6659756	eng	Tom was exhausted, but Mary wasn't.
6659820	eng	I didn't know that you weren't Canadian.
6659870	eng	Can you help me escape from this prison?
6660088	eng	I got tired of waiting, so I went home.
6660190	eng	I don't like golf as much as I used to.
6660325	eng	Could you please ask Tom if he's going to Boston?
6660379	eng	That's what Tom and I were told.
6660483	eng	I have no idea when I have to do that.
6660551	eng	Tom was sitting on that stump over there not too long ago.
6660730	eng	Tom stole some of my things.
6660812	eng	I love Tom's daughter.
6660831	eng	My boss has asked for my resignation.
6660844	eng	Tom is a lot better at French than you are.
6660986	eng	I'd be very interested in doing that.
6661034	eng	I have all of my suits made to order.
6661247	eng	Tom is amused by what's going on, but Mary isn't.
6661262	eng	Tom didn't seem to be as talkative as Mary.
6661265	eng	Tom is reliable, but Mary isn't.
6661362	eng	I wanted to kiss Tom, and I think he wanted to kiss me, too.
6661393	eng	I've always wished I had a daughter.
6661446	eng	Tom and I are going to be late for school if we don't hurry.
6661728	eng	Luckily, Tom wasn't killed in the accident.
6661779	eng	Tom likes swimming, but I don't.
6661859	eng	I'm the one who told Tom who to give it to.
6661870	eng	Do you want me to show you the plan?
6661923	eng	Which beer is Tom's?
6662060	eng	The police couldn't find Tom anywhere.
6662123	eng	I have to take care of Tom's dog next week.
6662180	eng	It was dark and I couldn't see what Tom was doing.
6662228	eng	I'm the one who bought Tom's old desk.
6662731	eng	Tom lives in a small house not far from the river.
6662915	eng	Tom played videogames all afternoon.
6663045	eng	Tom wanted to speak to us about something.
6663053	eng	What time will you get to Boston?
6663096	eng	Which dog is Tom's?
6663125	eng	I don't know if Tom will go camping with us or not.
6663163	eng	I'm going to do everything I can.
6663239	eng	Tom missed his bus.
6663348	eng	I got out of bed and got dressed.
6663494	eng	Tom always takes care of my dog whenever I leave town on business.
6663572	eng	Tom wasn't handcuffed, but Mary was.
6663605	eng	Tom wasn't discouraged, but Mary was.
6663628	eng	Tom didn't seem to be as busy as Mary seemed to be.
6663746	eng	Tom doesn't seem to be as attentive in class as the other students.
6663843	eng	I had good reason to be jealous.
6663854	eng	I can't change the way Tom is, but that doesn't stop me from trying.
6664030	eng	Tom always fulfills his promises.
6664127	eng	We had a lot of fun doing that.
6664217	eng	I'm going to come back at 2:30.
6664557	eng	Tom has offered to drive us home.
6664795	eng	I'll be here till next Monday.
6664831	eng	I should be there before 2:30.
6664882	eng	My car is newer than Tom's.
6665057	eng	The person Tom is talking to is Mary.
6665221	eng	I'll be there in three hours.
6665269	eng	I have a habit of doing that.
6665299	eng	I got stuck in a traffic jam.
6665364	eng	Tom was the last one to leave the office.
6665391	eng	I almost never ask questions.
6665816	eng	I don't like living in Boston and Tom doesn't either.
6665862	eng	Tom knows he can trust me.
6665949	eng	Tom isn't as slow as I am.
6665971	eng	You don't want Tom to go, do you?
6666242	eng	I'll see you next Monday.
6666318	eng	I got here at about 2:30.
6666491	eng	I hope Tom doesn't tell Mary what we did.
6666552	eng	I don't love my husband.
6666804	eng	I'll be free tomorrow.
6666831	eng	I had a great weekend.
6667013	eng	I didn't need to stay as long as Tom did.
6667063	eng	Tom is a better liar than Mary is.
6667130	eng	Let's go rowing.
6672628	eng	Sami opened the car door for Layla.
6673336	eng	Sami and Layla had a very rocky relationship.

6676375	eng	I suspect Tom has already left Boston.

6676391	eng	I suspect Tom would agree to do that.
6676457	eng	I suspect Tom and Mary are jealous.
6678133	eng	Tom is a high-roller.
6678160	eng	Tom helps his father out on the farm.
6678181	eng	Under different circumstances, their friendship could've developed into something more.
6678209	eng	No one but you could've done it this well.
6678226	eng	I wish I could've spoken French.
6678234	eng	I could've won the race if I hadn't sprained my ankle.
6678259	eng	I could've been hurt.

6703964	eng	He broke his jaw and lost a few teeth.
6703965	eng	He saved money.
6704034	eng	He was looking at you the whole time. Didn't you notice?
6704694	eng	Pick up your dog poop.
6705323	eng	He sees. It's water. He laughs. He dives.
6705504	eng	How much sugar do you want in your coffee?
6705508	eng	We often eat breakfast in the kitchen.
6706009	eng	Sami wanted to take a shower.
6706067	eng	Sami was sitting there.
6707083	eng	Speak more quietly.

6774823	eng	I've had many opportunities to do that.
6776694	eng	I've been told not to try to do that by myself.
6776755	eng	Tom does not understand Sanskrit.
6781599	eng	I didn't realize that I'd been doing that the wrong way.
6781654	eng	I've already told Tom that I plan on staying in Boston for another three weeks.
6783951	eng	Why was the train late?
6784008	eng	Didn't you know I was hoping Tom would do that?
6784133	eng	I've already told Tom what to bring to the party.
6785186	eng	He spake, and heart-sick with a load of care, / suppressed his grief, and feigned a cheerful air.
6785845	eng	Do you think that Tom and Mary were bored?
6787835	eng	Let's go fishing tomorrow.
6788824	eng	I know Tom will tell us the truth.
6789018	eng	Then his plaintive tone / no more could Venus bear, but interrupts her son: / "Stranger", she answered, "whosoe'er thou be; / not unbeloved of heavenly powers, I ween, / thou breath'st the vital air, whom Fate's decree / permits a Tyrian city to have seen."
6790231	eng	That writer's books are readable only with difficulty, because he uses too many unnecessary neologisms.
6790444	eng	Are you going to walk to the station?
6793204	eng	Should we help them?
6793838	eng	Sami hired one of the best lawyers in Cairo.
6796610	eng	Will Tom do that again?
6796808	eng	We need to make a list of things we need to buy.
6796843	eng	I would like to stay longer.

6797047	eng	Is this the soccer ball that you bought last month?
6797129	eng	Why's everybody staring at Tom?
6797918	eng	I can truly recommend this restaurant.
6798460	eng	Therewith the royal sceptre, which of yore / Ilione, Priam's eldest daughter, bore; / her shining necklace, strung with costly beads, / and diadem, rimmed with gold and studded o'er / with sparkling gems. Thus charged, Achates heeds, / and towards the ships forthwith in eager haste proceeds.
6799100	eng	Tom and I eat lunch together.
6799150	eng	I stayed at my uncle's while I was in Boston.
6799922	eng	Where are the garden shears?
6800179	eng	Within are fifty maidens, charged with care / to dress the food, and nurse the flames divine. / A hundred more, and youths like-aged, prepare / to load the tables and arrange the wine.
6800343	eng	So spake the Queen, and on the festal board / the prime libation to the gods outpoured, / then lightly to her lips the goblet pressed, / and gave to Bitias. Challenged by the word, / he dived into the brimming gold with zest, / and quaffed the foaming bowl, and after him, the rest.
6802331	eng	It's all your fault!
6802637	eng	I didn't know that Tom couldn't swim.
6802734	eng	I didn't know Tom was living on Park Street.
6802807	eng	How did you know that Tom was adopted?
6803339	eng	I didn't say I'd help you.
6805712	eng	I felt ignored.
6806449	eng	Sami doesn't want to talk about it.
6806461	eng	Sami had many issues.

6806706	eng	Sami sent Layla some really disgusting stuff.
6806779	eng	Sami doesn't have any family and friends.
6807081	eng	Sami is completely harmless.
6807185	eng	Sami is back to buy the boots.
6807189	eng	Sami doesn't have to know.
6808390	eng	If you do it once more, you will be sacked immediately.
6809602	eng	Sami was in his freshman year.
6809814	eng	Sami doesn't want to talk to people.
6809817	eng	Sami shouldn't talk to Layla.
6809902	eng	I'm home almost every night.
6810020	eng	Sami was watching that.
6810031	eng	Sami bought some stuff.
6810324	eng	I told Tom Mary was busy.
6810390	eng	Sami won't stop until he gets what he wants.
6810557	eng	Sami studied psychiatry.
6811414	eng	'And louder still, when towered the horse on high / with maple timbers, pealed the thunder through the sky.'
6811830	eng	"Ten days the seer, as shrinking to reply / or name a victim, did the doom withhold."
6812128	eng	I think Tom was here.
6812506	eng	You're better at remembering things than I am.
6812638	eng	It's very limited.
6813177	eng	All aboard, please! The train is leaving right away.
6814144	eng	I won't call Tom.
6814573	eng	When lo! – the tale I shudder to pursue – / from Tenedos in silence, side by side, / two monstrous serpents, horrible to view, / with coils enormous leaning on the tide, / shoreward, with even stretch, the tranquil sea divide.
6815055	eng	Do you really think anybody will vote for you?
6816877	eng	I cut the dead trees down.
6817126	eng	So when the bold and compact band I see, / "Brave hearts", I cry, "but brave, alas! in vain; / if firm your purpose holds to follow me / who dare the worst, our present plight is plain. / Troy's guardian gods have left her; altar, fane, / all is deserted, every temple bare. / The town ye aid is burning. Forward, then, / to die and mingle in the tumult's blare."
6818266	eng	It's exactly the way I remember it.
6819944	eng	Stanisław Jerzy Lec once said: Sometimes you have to be silent to make yourself heard.
6821853	eng	It won't be as hard to do as you think.
6821946	eng	Do you really think Tom is a good cook?
6822324	eng	In France, voting isn't mandatory.
6823419	eng	I don't think Tom and Mary are so strange.
6823504	eng	Maybe you'd better go and see what Tom is doing.
6823519	eng	Could you give me a ride to the bus stop?
6823544	eng	Mary was glued to her phone.
6823613	eng	Let's just say that I wasn't surprised.
6823810	eng	Your nickname fits you perfectly.
6823936	eng	Sami is not short on enemies.
6823952	eng	Sami loved computers.
6824052	eng	That shop closed in 2013.
6824194	eng	Maybe I'll be back.
6825816	eng	Tom doesn't waste anything.
6826977	eng	How long have you been learning German?
6826981	eng	Why don't you just sit down and relax?
6827067	eng	Tom doesn't remember where he put his passport.
6828361	eng	Tom and Mary have finished their homework.
6829625	eng	Why don't you ask Tom how he did that?
6829936	eng	Why don't you go ahead and eat?
6830157	eng	Sami can't leave Layla.
6831311	eng	Tom did what I expected him to do.
6831636	eng	We stayed up until about 2:30 studying for today's test.
6833022	eng	I just don't have the time.
6833076	eng	I'm not sure why I'm supposed to do that.
6833234	eng	He is sparkling and well-mannered.
6833237	eng	I like people with lisps. My ears enjoy hearing their voices!
6835833	eng	Give me another little kiss.
6836370	eng	Tom is presumed innocent.
6838571	eng	I know that Tom has gone.
6838580	eng	I know Tom was displeased.
6838624	eng	I know Tom was horrified.
6838687	eng	I know that Tom is thin.
6838876	eng	What type of person is Tom?
6839359	eng	You can depend on Tom's help.
6840885	eng	We live too much in books and not enough in nature.
6841523	eng	Tom has made coffee.
6841621	eng	I let go of Tom's hand.
6842680	eng	Tom knew I was jealous.
6842682	eng	Tom knew I was optimistic.
6842717	eng	Some of the men laughed.
6842735	eng	Breakfast is almost ready.
6842737	eng	Don't walk alone at night.
6842905	eng	I began studying French when I was thirteen.
6844957	eng	Tom does that faster than you.
6845115	eng	It happened in Boston.
6846852	eng	There isn't anything we can do about that.
6847241	eng	Do you feel the difference now?
6848977	eng	It's going to be difficult to find someone to replace Tom.
6848996	eng	Can anybody help us do this?
6849061	eng	The sound woke us up.
6849088	eng	That's wonderful news.
6849112	eng	Give us just one minute.
6851168	eng	Tom is the smartest kid in our class.
6853225	eng	Grim horror seized me, and aghast I stood.
6854319	eng	The base is surrounded.
6855606	eng	My parents get really mad when they argue.
6855832	eng	It would be unwise to do that.
6857181	eng	Tom doesn't want to do anything else.
6857193	eng	Who are you closest to in your family?
6857208	eng	Tom married the most beautiful girl in the city.
6858743	eng	Tom gazed at his reflection in the mirror.
6860468	eng	The steaks were grilled to perfection.
6860715	eng	He tried to put the moves on her.
6860948	eng	Tears started flowing from her eyes.
6861470	eng	Prohibition isn't taken seriously by anyone.
6861510	eng	Her face is scattered with freckles.
6861523	eng	Did you think I didn't notice anything?
6863241	eng	Do you think children born today will have better lives than their parents?
6863418	eng	Can I have some of these?
6864818	eng	Neither of these is Tom's.
6864921	eng	Neither of my brothers will be there.
6864981	eng	There are a lot of borrowed words in my language.
6865018	eng	Tom should tell you what to do.
6866148	eng	I think they would make a great couple.
6866415	eng	The implementation of the new strategy will take a few weeks.
6867275	eng	Sami always drinks.
6867792	eng	Has Tom been doing that long?
6867883	eng	I felt that Tom wasn't doing everything he should have been doing.
6868019	eng	Who should have done that?
6868224	eng	That should have been expected.
6868480	eng	You should have gone home already.
6869127	eng	Tom and Mary both should have stayed awake.
6869291	eng	I should have told Tom to stay away from Mary.
6869416	eng	You should have told Tom that he had to do that.
6869559	eng	I should have told Tom that I didn't know any French.
6869586	eng	That wasn't the main reason Tom should have done that.
6869620	eng	I should have advised Tom not to believe what Mary says.
6869974	eng	Tom probably could have told us how to do it.
6870096	eng	I wish I could have done the same thing.
6870360	eng	I could have been mistaken.
6870495	eng	Tom would have gotten away with it if Mary hadn't seen you do that.
6870527	eng	If Tom had stayed in his hometown, he never would have met Mary.
6870529	eng	I wish I would have been more aware of what was going to happen.

8378975	eng	There is no such administrative or political entity called Kabylie. In fact, this region has no distinct political status and is an integral part of Algeria.
8379206	eng	Would you mind a bit of advice?
8380507	eng	Tom is hoping to go skating with Mary.
8380935	eng	Tom is a very picky eater.
8381131	eng	Tom will be surprised how difficult it'll be to do that.
8381151	eng	Tom isn't sure if Mary can understand French.
8382178	eng	Tom always buys milk.
8382252	eng	Tom used to be a hard worker.
8382286	eng	Tom and Mary didn't go to the lake together.
8382366	eng	Tom greets Mary every morning.
8382378	eng	I thought about it for a few minutes and then said no.
8382487	eng	Tom didn't get Mary's joke.
8382591	eng	I'm a bit of a fanatic.
8382707	eng	My sister's name is Mary.
8382772	eng	My parents live in log house.
8382849	eng	My closet is full of junk I never use anymore.
8382860	eng	My cup is empty.
8383962	eng	My dog can swim quite well.
8384029	eng	Tom was surprised to see Mary at the party.
8385159	eng	Who allowed that?
8385640	eng	I'm older.
8385923	eng	That sounds all right to me.
8385940	eng	Our project is going OK.
8386159	eng	Tom will give his speech in French.
8387110	eng	Did Tom agree with you?
8387307	eng	I've been living in Algeria for exactly one month.
8387456	eng	Tom should study French, too.
8387518	eng	Islamic teachings are clear and simple.
8388668	eng	See you again next weekend.
8388759	eng	Tom is at the end of the line.
8388796	eng	It might rain soon.
8390378	eng	What are you so excited about?
8390403	eng	Tell the police what you saw.
8390439	eng	Tom asked me why Mary was so unhappy.
8390450	eng	Who did you go to the lake with?

8392274	eng	Do you have a lot of friends here?
8392283	eng	I wanted Tom to go outside and play.
8392666	eng	It's a picture of Skura.
8392801	eng	He knows his birth mother.
8393106	eng	The imam gave me a book.
8394210	eng	That's not the answer I'd hoped for.
8394378	eng	Your daughter needs help.
8394518	eng	I'm not capable of faking happiness and you know that.
8394871	eng	Someone posted the video on YouTube.
8394935	eng	If you are tired, you should go to bed.
8395595	eng	You've ruined your clothes.
8395649	eng	The kids will have fun there.
8395658	eng	Tom doesn't need money now.
8396151	eng	His dad seemed pretty upset.
8396154	eng	Can we talk about this in the morning?
8396259	eng	She has beautiful boobs.
8396335	eng	He found that picture in a magazine.
8396459	eng	Bratislava is Slovakia's capital.
8397449	eng	Tom won't be the first one to get off the bus.
8397687	eng	I care.
8397692	eng	I froze.
8397876	eng	I've never been a junkie.
8397879	eng	My great-great-great-grandfather was a pirate.
8397937	eng	I don't have to sing.

8398600	eng	It didn't pay off.
8398858	eng	I chased Tom.
8398930	eng	I gave Tom a push.
8399085	eng	I've just returned.
8399125	eng	I've talked it over with Tom.
8399622	eng	He went to Algeria for a break.
8400291	eng	I've worked so hard.
8400791	eng	I'll never speak to him again.
8400869	eng	He's not racist.
8400877	eng	He never did it.
8400960	eng	I've made a few mistakes.
8400984	eng	Are the Amish friendly to outsiders?
8401190	eng	Tom was surprised Mary was on John's side.
8401192	eng	Tom and I've said our goodbyes.
8401214	eng	My flight leaves at 2:30.
8401527	eng	I've made too many mistakes.
8401571	eng	I know I've never done that.
8401701	eng	I've been asked not to leave.
8401797	eng	He gave me a kiss in response.
8401816	eng	I don't have more.
8401880	eng	I have question about the Quran.
8401923	eng	Has your conversion to Islam affected your family?
8401946	eng	What's a Muslim?
8402018	eng	He has announced to the world that he has converted to Islam.
8402052	eng	He gave us a book about Islam.
8402884	eng	I've been doing that all year.
8402982	eng	I've been given several jobs to do.
8403041	eng	I haven't eaten any meat since last October.
8403517	eng	I do miss Boston.
8403690	eng	He trusted her.
8404005	eng	Tom said he'd be very surprised if Mary didn't win the tournament.
8405430	eng	This is a very inspiring speech.
8405779	eng	He finds her terrifying.
8405971	eng	I can walk back, so you don't need to give me a ride.
8406033	eng	I doubt that we'll be allowed to do that here.
8407324	eng	I only spoke French at that time.
8408470	eng	He shall burn in hell.
8409401	eng	I hate this show.
8409699	eng	Her voice is naturally high.
8410030	eng	Fortunately for today’s scientists, Apollo-era leaders had the foresight to save much of the 842 pounds (382 kilograms) of Moon soil and rocks retrieved by NASA astronauts 50 years ago for future generations. They figured new crops of scientists, using instruments of their time, would be able to probe the samples with unprecedented rigor.
8410491	eng	Why aren't you wearing your scarf?
8410731	eng	I think that Tom isn't Canadian.
8410786	eng	Does anybody here speak French well?
8411527	eng	He really began thinking seriously about converting to Islam.
8411546	eng	Islam made him a better person.
8412669	eng	The facts are plain. No one can deny them.
8414692	eng	Islam is a nice and easy religion.
8414700	eng	Islam protects us.
8414739	eng	He had all the trappings of a great life.
8414748	eng	What does Ramadan mean?
8414754	eng	Tom takes pride in his work.
8414956	eng	I've been faithful to you since we met.

8416679	eng	Tom ate well.
8416709	eng	Tom began.
8416843	eng	He intuitively absorbs those tricks.
8416866	eng	I don't need validation from anyone.
8419000	eng	I asked the question in Berber.
8419140	eng	I've purchased his latest novel.
8419254	eng	How long will it take us to do this?
8419276	eng	How soon will you be ready to leave?
8420280	eng	Tom is the son of two famous painters.
8423444	eng	Where are you going, daddy?
8424002	eng	In English, the words a or an are indefinite articles that are used to refer to a person or thing that is non-specific, such as something generic or something mentioned for the first time.
8424472	eng	Tom wasn't the one who dealt with that problem.
8424493	eng	Hiring a non-native French speaker to write the report in French is like hiring a carpenter to fix your plumbing.
8426745	eng	This gift is from Tom and me.
8426845	eng	When and where did you first meet Tom?
8428998	eng	I really don't understand what he means by that.
8429197	eng	Girls like alpha males.

8430198	eng	Tom left for Australia to fight forest fires.
8430266	eng	Prohibited calculators are not allowed.
8430897	eng	I'll protect you and Tom.
8431167	eng	I have my doubts about Tom's sincerity.
8433994	eng	Don't yell at Tom and me.
8434283	eng	You will regret that, Tom.
8435496	eng	Mary didn't want to hurt her friend's feelings.
8435757	eng	How much of a help are you to your parents?
8436085	eng	I really love this place.
8436191	eng	Did you get much sleep?
8436200	eng	This isn't the book that I was reading.
8437548	eng	How many cups do you need?
8437925	eng	I thought Tom and Mary handled themselves well.
8438286	eng	There were thirty people on the bus including the driver.
8439978	eng	We need to focus on just one thing.
8440002	eng	We didn't bring enough water.
8440349	eng	You need to go there today.
8440559	eng	I was born in the Boston and grew up in Chicago.
8440641	eng	If it's hot outside, I'd rather stay inside.
8440864	eng	Nobody at the airport would tell us anything about the crash.
8442337	eng	If you’re not busy, could you please shelve these books?
8443330	eng	We're eight people altogether.
8444133	eng	Do we need to hurry up?
8445470	eng	Please put down that book and listen to me.
8445496	eng	How much did you spend on your last shopping spree?
8445845	eng	Thanks for never giving up on me, Mary.
8447990	eng	I know Luxembourgish, German, French and English.
8451968	eng	She showed him the letter from his father.

8455969	eng	Tom loves his dogs.
8456175	eng	Tom gave Mary his dogs.
8456289	eng	I really like this dog.
8456302	eng	Tom pulled the dog's tail.
8456371	eng	Tom's dog has a long tail.
8456430	eng	Tom wanted a medium-size dog, but Mary wanted a small dog.
8456455	eng	Your dog seems to be full of energy.
8456517	eng	Tom took his dogs to the beach with him.
8456679	eng	Somebody tried to steal Tom's dog.
8464210	eng	"God be with you!" "Yeah."
8466143	eng	Religious fundamentalists prefer to advocate the teaching of abstinence instead of the teaching of safe sex.
8466607	eng	I detest Tom for what he has done to Mary.
8466698	eng	They asked Tom about his working experience. He said that he had none.
8469628	eng	Are you sure that it's a human bone?
8469878	eng	Eventually, Tom gave up on the idea of escaping.
8470116	eng	Did you just call me a liar?
8470129	eng	When will Tom call you?
8472103	eng	He hid under the table.
8472234	eng	The basket is full of apples.
8473312	eng	I'm taking the tram.
8473584	eng	Free Tibet!
8474983	eng	He asked me how long my parents had been married before they separated.
8475487	eng	He ate.
8475598	eng	He's new.
8475858	eng	He's stuck.
8476054	eng	He was weak.
8476141	eng	He's injured.
8476183	eng	He's grumpy.
8476722	eng	He's similar.
8476805	eng	He can see me.
8476986	eng	He loves cake.
8476996	eng	He loves zoos.
8477140	eng	He was cranky.
8477286	eng	He's a father.
8477341	eng	He's agitated.
8477351	eng	He has an alibi.

8480111	eng	He's chosen you.
8480327	eng	He's packing up.
8480400	eng	He's the killer.
8480584	eng	He blushed again.
8480690	eng	He did very well.
8480977	eng	He has three dogs.
8481981	eng	Do you really think she won't like my gift?
8485238	eng	That's a very small tree.
8490193	eng	Sheik is a term synonymous with great power, respect, and wealth, and often religion.
8495309	eng	He hates Berber.
8499856	eng	He went to that store to buy a belly button ring.
8499904	eng	He loved her belly button ring so much.
8500887	eng	Members of the European Parliament sang and held hands after a vote on the UK's withdrawal from the EU.
8505206	eng	I've already been told I'm not going to be allowed to do that.
8505542	eng	I'm not as naive as a lot of people think I am.
8505561	eng	Tom was the first to sit down.
8505565	eng	Let's back up a bit.
8505568	eng	I'm not rich, but I'm happy.
8505759	eng	He is facing a challenge.
8505867	eng	He needs to call a doctor.
8506060	eng	02-02-2020 is a palindrome, because its digits read the same forward and backwards.
8506513	eng	Do whatever you want to.
8507054	eng	It'll be a struggle.
8507122	eng	We only accept cash.
8508281	eng	He finally quit smoking.
8508369	eng	We should finish this project soon, maybe even by the end of this week.
8508463	eng	I want you to know that I won't be there tomorrow afternoon.
8508569	eng	Tom soon realized that he'd never be able to do that.
8508886	eng	Tom said he and his wife were planning to be here.
8509019	eng	Guess which is which.
8509296	eng	It doesn't affect me.
8509349	eng	It makes total sense.
8509832	eng	It's a rare disorder.
8510000	eng	Tom didn't get the treatment he needed.
8510373	eng	It's indeed very sad.
8510401	eng	It's just really fun.
8510433	eng	Tom took off his mask.
8510641	eng	Nobody had any money.
8510652	eng	No one told me what I was supposed to do.
8510736	eng	We finally managed to persuade Tom to help us.
8510955	eng	What's the real goal?
8510956	eng	That's the sad truth.
8512755	eng	It has been raining the whole day.
8512908	eng	He joined the Algerian military.
8512922	eng	When did you move to Algeria?
8513100	eng	He's the only Algerian in my group of friends.
8513166	eng	He pleaded guilty to drunken driving and his driver's license was suspended for six months.
8513237	eng	She's sick, but it isn't serious.
8513259	eng	That's an amazing plan.
8513423	eng	She'll try to help him.
8513605	eng	She's always been faithful to him.
8513613	eng	She's never told me how she met him.
8513646	eng	He's located her.
8513654	eng	He's eloped with her.
8513888	eng	She stopped talking to him.
8514173	eng	He opened the gate for her.
8514562	eng	He accepted an expensive gift from her.
8514582	eng	She lived just down the street from him.
8514666	eng	She lent her bicycle to him.
8514800	eng	She left part of her estate to him.

8515642	eng	He told me he's never talked to her.
8515721	eng	She said she'd do what she could for him.
8516025	eng	He couldn't remember where he'd first met her.
8516107	eng	She says that she doesn't know anything about him.
8516161	eng	She must've forgotten what she promised to do for him.
8516275	eng	She screamed at him.
8516329	eng	He used to laugh at her.
8517168	eng	That's our goal here.
8517250	eng	That's what we'll do.
8517254	eng	I want to be able to play the violin as well as Tom.
8517668	eng	I heard Tom muttering something in French.
8519085	eng	He didn't want to work for her.
8519151	eng	She and I are both waiting for him.
8519454	eng	He doesn't really talk to her.
8519595	eng	She wanted to say something to him.
8519786	eng	She wasn't the one who gave that to him.
8519792	eng	He wants to get married, but not to her.
8519875	eng	She softly closed the door and tiptoed over to him.
8519877	eng	She knew that the dog on the porch belonged to him.
8519982	eng	She made friends with him.
8520214	eng	He likes talking about her.
8520306	eng	She couldn't stop talking about him.
8520355	eng	She pretended not to know anything about him.
8520527	eng	He walked towards her.
8520832	eng	She just kissed him.
8520943	eng	She absolutely detests him.
8520956	eng	She instantly recognized him.
8521149	eng	She isn't helping him.
8521272	eng	She wanted to marry him.
8521417	eng	He tried not to hurt her.
8521627	eng	She isn't going to let that stop her.
8521692	eng	He doesn't want to do anything to hurt her.
8521720	eng	He wasn't able to meet her.
8521745	eng	He still doesn't trust her.
8521922	eng	She didn't want to marry him.
8521933	eng	He couldn't have helped her.
8521952	eng	He doesn't really trust her.
8522207	eng	She wasn't able to protect him.
8522220	eng	He had difficulty finding her.
8522312	eng	She asked if anyone had seen him.
8522489	eng	He didn't even attempt to kiss her.
8522547	eng	She had no choice but to support him.
8522715	eng	Things will get a lot worse before they get better.
8523054	eng	Why don't we ask someone?
8523233	eng	When he was young, he ate three eggs every day.
8523775	eng	I want you to tell Tom he can't come here anymore.
8525400	eng	He whispered in her ear how much he loved her.
8525453	eng	She told him she needed his help.
8525518	eng	He asked her about her family.
8525710	eng	She told him that she couldn't live without him.
8525886	eng	She called him and told him that she'd be late.
8526054	eng	He's unlikely to do that by himself.

9246415	eng	Who came here today?
9246538	eng	Don't over-tighten the nut.

9248570	eng	Yanni's left arm became limp.
9248767	eng	Is the road good?
9250259	eng	Tom ate everything that Mary gave him.
9250477	eng	Now that our police force is larger, the crime rate is likely to decline.
9250536	eng	Tom stared at the floor.

9270895	eng	What a great song!
9271077	eng	There's someone waiting in your office.

9372384	eng	How long has Tom been playing the violin?
9373262	eng	Let me have a bite of that.
9373329	eng	It's too crowded here.
9373557	eng	Tom found out what Mary expected him to do.
9373966	eng	What you're in the mosque, you pray to God.
9374616	eng	Yanni made a little map of Algiers.
9375355	eng	Yanni and Skura started talking again about the Berber language.
9381364	eng	Tom will probably want you to do that.
9381538	eng	Yanni's room was only lit by the TV.
9383818	eng	Tom didn't tell his parents what happened.
9387346	eng	The subway is coming.
9387445	eng	You're too hot-tempered.
9387509	eng	He is staring at him.
9387983	eng	Yanni made a few sales.
9388033	eng	Yanni was from Algiers.
9388263	eng	Yanni didn't maintain eye contact and was evasive.
9388281	eng	Yanni was addicted to that game.
9388295	eng	Yanni was always trying to be sweet and romantic.
9388319	eng	The day went by normally.
9388419	eng	Yanni walked out of the gas station.
9388425	eng	Yanni called the police immediately after.
9390277	eng	Tom's a real closet case.
9391391	eng	Till now I thought he lied. Now I know.
9391648	eng	Tom seldom eats meat.
9392635	eng	Tom opened the drawer and began to rummage through it.
9392786	eng	What if Tom isn't at home?
9393680	eng	Just because you tell us it's interesting doesn't make it interesting.
9397200	eng	Tom decided to stay behind.
9399680	eng	Tom wasn't able to get out of the car.
9399852	eng	Tom is very similar to you.
9400305	eng	Yanni was at the end of his rope.
9400312	eng	Yanni has lived in Algeria his entire life. He was even born there.
9400762	eng	We meet at last! I've waited so long for this moment.
9400858	eng	Every right is limited by everyone else's rights.
9401344	eng	Yanni lived in a small town in the south of Algeria.
9401596	eng	Tom chickened out and retreated.
9408322	eng	I don't think I agree.
9408522	eng	Tidy up the room.
9409500	eng	Yanni's brother isn't religious.
9410494	eng	Yanni was in Algeria with his girlfriend.
9410818	eng	What's lighter than air?
9413905	eng	We were frozen with fear.
9414318	eng	Tom didn't do the reading.
9414329	eng	I was hoping to talk to Tom.
9414409	eng	Sounds impossible.
9414889	eng	It won't be safe to do that.
9415478	eng	I'm trying to have it ready tonight.
9416064	eng	There's no comparison.
9418982	eng	Did Tom sound excited?
9419070	eng	Don't you dare say that again.
9419125	eng	Tom was a very careful man.
9419243	eng	I still cherish the necklace you gave me ten years ago.
9419316	eng	I'm alright, I'm just busy.
9420026	eng	I helped Tom get off the couch.
9421363	eng	How long will you be with us?
9423684	eng	Yanni's life depends on it.
9423744	eng	Yanni pretended that he didn't understand Berber.
9424217	eng	Stop bothering the cat.
9431886	eng	I want to travel around Australia.
9431921	eng	How much money do you make a month?
9432414	eng	How should we deal with this?
9432652	eng	He returned his book.
9432967	eng	Yanni is working on a novel trilogy.
9433892	eng	Where were those pictures taken?
9434945	eng	Have you shown this to Tom?
9435286	eng	He's a talented chess player.
9437254	eng	We've decided to sell our house.
9440155	eng	I can't find his address.
9440304	eng	We make the same mistakes again and again.
9440342	eng	It seems somehow odd to me.
9440403	eng	Algeria needs millions of jobs to boost its economy.
9440568	eng	He gave up his seat to an elderly lady.
9441017	eng	How many miles did Tom run?
9444006	eng	Make sure that you haven't forgotten anyone.
9444132	eng	When are we going there?
9444364	eng	It's cold and wintry.
9444477	eng	Will you come early tomorrow, too?
9444521	eng	The train slowed and finally came to a halt.
9444562	eng	In winter, I long for the warm sea and the hot sun.
9445385	eng	Why are you listening to Tom?
9445948	eng	Tom isn't as lucky as Mary is.
9446359	eng	I'm connected 24 hours a day.
9447069	eng	Tom fired his gun as soon as he saw me.
9447703	eng	"Cassandra, you can meditate focusing on an object, like a gem or a cactus plant." "I'll try, Sheela."
9447834	eng	There's not much wine left.
9447841	eng	Today I will go to bed early.
9447850	eng	I am not good enough.
9448302	eng	You need to release Tom.
9448757	eng	We'll take the next bus.
9451386	eng	"Jack, at the Thai temple, we meditators use a big empty hall with a hardwood floor. At night, we use candlelight." "What a romantic setting, Sam!"
9451746	eng	I'm already bald.
9451813	eng	This is a tablecloth.
9453351	eng	Tom likes going on cycling trips.
9453391	eng	We must've been wrong.
9453494	eng	Tom can give factual statements in French, but he can't discuss abstract concepts.
9454096	eng	Until you ask him, Tom won't do that.
9457955	eng	We've decided to sell all our paintings.
9458260	eng	We still have a lot of things we need to do.
9458961	eng	Things have rapidly changed in Algeria.
9459283	eng	Put your shoes on.
9460438	eng	It's of great significance.
9460633	eng	Can you shut the door, please?
9460655	eng	He's a physio.
9460776	eng	What's your favourite joke?
9460830	eng	The left back called the referee an idiot.
9462229	eng	Let's race.
9462581	eng	I'm a user of that app too.
9462651	eng	This theme dominates throughout the book.
9463245	eng	Go and visit your mother.
9464975	eng	I could've done this without your help.
9466243	eng	It's OK. You're safe now.
9466261	eng	I wasn't selected.
9471762	eng	I saw Tom get out of a taxi.
9471793	eng	Tom won't go back there again.
9471865	eng	Someone has to tell Tom the truth.
9471917	eng	I've seen that face before.
9472241	eng	This flat is small for us four.
9472654	eng	Sit yourself down, Tom. I've made a bit of supper.
9472774	eng	It's about thirty-minute walk to the station.
9472897	eng	What would happen to the Algerian economy?
9474028	eng	I don't know how to tell her.
9475885	eng	Does Tom like reading books?
9475901	eng	I think Tom is going to ask for a promotion.
9476107	eng	Algeria is part of the developing world.
9476381	eng	That's very rare, though.
9477171	eng	Tom fell and injured his knee.
9479076	eng	There's no need for you to be sad.
9480104	eng	I'd like a steaming hot cup of tea.
9480111	eng	She keeps her tea in the middle cupboard.
9480630	eng	Tom doesn't really want to go to the dance.
9481205	eng	If my wife sits next to me, I drive more slowly.
9481501	eng	The stew was delicious.
9483136	eng	A rose is a flower and a dove is a bird.
9483377	eng	Will you still be living in Boston next year?
9487802	eng	We need to come up with a new strategy.
9488166	eng	The child isn't crying anymore.
9488887	eng	I won't come here again.
9488956	eng	I'll meet you at the station at 2:30 tomorrow afternoon.
9489184	eng	I need to call my parents.
9493082	eng	The snowplough couldn't get past.
9493097	eng	Only fresh vegetables are sold here.
9493639	eng	Tom will never listen to anyone who disagrees with him.
9493905	eng	Which one is hers?
9494143	eng	He'll have to walk.
9494175	eng	She wrapped the scarf round her neck.
9496000	eng	Don't buy it again.
9496320	eng	One wonders why so many SAT words are requested here.
9496623	eng	Yanni will never forget Skura's face so long as he lives.
9498993	eng	What's this fun about?
9499211	eng	Surprisingly, he quickly became hostile after a lukewarm welcome.
9500071	eng	We need to get away from Tom.
9501113	eng	We have to tell Tom everything.
9501134	eng	Tom is fascinated by snakes.
9501153	eng	In the cities the quarters for the wealthier classes are not so sharply defined as with us, though the love for pleasant outlooks and beautiful scenery tends to enhance the value of certain districts, and consequently to bring together the wealthier classes. In nearly all the cities, however, you will find the houses of the wealthy in the immediate vicinity of the habitations of the poorest. In Tokio one may find streets, or narrow alleys, lined with a continuous row of the cheapest shelters; and here dwell the poorest people. Though squalid and dirty as such places appear to the Japanese, they are immaculate in comparison with the unutterable filth and misery of similar quarters in nearly all the great cities of Christendom. Certainly a rich man in Japan would not, as a general thing, buy up the land about his house to keep the poorer classes at a distance, for the reason that their presence would not be objectionable, since poverty in Japan is not associated with the impossible manners of a similar class at home.
9501494	eng	Stop spamming the chat.
9503225	eng	Don't you feel the same way, too?
9505365	eng	Tom knew what we needed.
9505374	eng	Tom no longer stammers.
9506110	eng	Leave me alone! I'm not your wife anymore.
9506241	eng	Tom looked terribly frightened.
9506559	eng	Algeria is one and indivisible.
9509894	eng	This is the street you were telling me about.
9511192	eng	Let's come here next spring. / Please come here next spring.
9511349	eng	Yanni doesn't know how to celebrate Christmas.
9511389	eng	"Are you Muslim?" "Of course."
9513881	eng	He is ready soon.
9516788	eng	A meteor lit up the night sky.
9517260	eng	Jobs are hard to find now.
9517274	eng	Antique cars in good condition are hard to find.
9517392	eng	I want to buy a car, but I don't have enough money for a down payment.
9517739	eng	People in the Northern Hemisphere are in for a once-in-a-millennium treat on December 21 — the winter solstice and the longest night of the year — when Jupiter and Saturn will meet in a “great conjunction,” the closest they will be seen in the sky together for nearly 800 years.
9517888	eng	It took a while to get here.
9517994	eng	I'd try looking for it next to the tinned fruit section at the back of the shop.
9518565	eng	Why didn't you call anybody?
9519740	eng	You're missing something.
9522961	eng	Do you have sugar? The tea is very bitter.
9524243	eng	Vegetables are growing on this field.
9524613	eng	Are you positive about that?
9524759	eng	I usually shop with a shopping list.
9524863	eng	The quilt can't be washed.
9524955	eng	I gave it away to him.
9525359	eng	Tom has nothing to do with the kidnapping.
9525714	eng	They put on those glasses.
9525855	eng	The justification is worse than the act.
9526058	eng	We used to live on the third floor.
9530274	eng	He's just missed the bus.
9539803	eng	We would only bother them.
9539892	eng	Does she live round here?
9548556	eng	I don't know where he came from.
9548654	eng	Do you need all this?
9553706	eng	Goodnight, Tatoeba.
9563826	eng	Are there any good news?
9564684	eng	I don't like this hat. Is there one with a narrower brim?
9564914	eng	You have to rehydrate.
9570741	eng	We value privacy.
9573113	eng	Four companies bid for the tender.
9579098	eng	Despite my expectations, he turned out to be a nice person.
9589514	eng	Yanni and Skura are serving life sentences.
9594184	eng	We'll leave first thing in the morning.
9594360	eng	Several of Tom's ancestors were pirates.
9601661	eng	Of course, we'll blame them.
9602051	eng	We need to find someone to help Tom.
9602457	eng	Tom sure does eat a lot.
9607629	eng	Won't you give me the floor?
9615371	eng	Tom wants to know how he can help.
9620662	eng	You're annoying me, Tom.
9621282	eng	Tom bought me a present.
9621979	eng	It's time to make a change.
9622162	eng	It's never going to go out of style.
9623037	eng	The horses all ran away.
9624278	eng	That was a really great plan.
9628542	eng	Some of my friends aren't married.
9628703	eng	How did you find that?
9630129	eng	Several people in the audience laughed quietly.
9630657	eng	We know how to drive.
9630732	eng	That was my initial question, too.
9632462	eng	Tom said that I'd find you here.
9632809	eng	Take the bag.
9633340	eng	I thought she would get off with just a warning and a fine, but they threw the entire book at her.
9635678	eng	The Polisario Front isn't a separatist movement because Western Sahara has never been part of Morocco, whereas Ferhat Mehenni's group is an insignificant separatist organization that seeks to separate Kabylie from Algeria of which it has always been part.
9637170	eng	They are speaking French.
9637899	eng	Yanni realized that things weren't going to go his way.
9638709	eng	"Have you received the telegram?" "No, I didn't receive it."
9640746	eng	I believe Tom when he says he doesn't speak French.
9640836	eng	That was the last time Tom was here.
9640854	eng	Did I say you could use my phone?
9640859	eng	I could do that, but I won't.
9641011	eng	Is it impossible to live to be 150?
9641975	eng	I hear that a lot.
9642538	eng	I am an electrician, ain't I?
9643596	eng	This piano is heavy.
9645211	eng	I really like drinking.
9649547	eng	Could someone let the dog in?
9649856	eng	Tom was given the same chance you and I were given.
9651526	eng	Thank you. We appreciate it.
9653237	eng	Look, let me try this again.
9653354	eng	Tom talked Mary out of doing that.
9659557	eng	We found that very easy to do.
9662772	eng	I'll tell you everything when I get back.
9662778	eng	Tom managed to reach Mary by phone.
9663262	eng	I'll make sure to be here to see you off.
9665179	eng	I want Tom to be with me.
9666099	eng	Why doesn't she go back home?
9666204	eng	That little computer over there is the actuator of everything else in this room.
9666353	eng	Are you afraid of Tom too?
9667176	eng	The problem is I don't remember where I parked my car.
9668227	eng	All I ate was a banana.
9668280	eng	I travel by metro.
9668982	eng	Yanni was enjoying afternoon coffee with his relatives.
9670167	eng	A mine is an area or tunnel where valuable substances are dug out of the earth.
9670838	eng	Nobody asked me for anything.
9671016	eng	Tom isn't cooking dinner. He's baking bread.
9671257	eng	Yanni's wife is sick and needs constant care.
9671507	eng	Yanni appealed on the grounds of insanity. In fact, he had been diagnosed with schizophrenia.
9672548	eng	I blasphemed him.
9672723	eng	Could you translate this sentence to Spanish?
9672756	eng	You never wash the floor.
9673118	eng	That'll probably happen soon.
9673925	eng	Tom didn't seem motivated to do that.
9674771	eng	Tom walks a lot.
9677160	eng	Yanni saw Skura with another man and that was the straw that broke the camel's back.
9677520	eng	I am content.
9677868	eng	He should've listened to them.
9678257	eng	Is he throwing away everything?
9679003	eng	I'll figure out how to tell him.
9679324	eng	Skura is a supremely vulnerable woman.
9679361	eng	Politics doesn't have to be a raging fire.
9679749	eng	The wastage of muscle tissue is a problem.
9681268	eng	Tom hung the laundry up on the clothesline.
9681317	eng	I haven't been to my parents' house again.
9681891	eng	You know that I'd die for you.
9682553	eng	Yanni shot the man Skura was having an affair with.
9682762	eng	"I don't think Yanni is ready for that." "How come?"
9684257	eng	Soccer is a fun game to play.
9684837	eng	Are you also afraid of Tom?
9685494	eng	I'll say a prayer for you tomorrow.
9687006	eng	Tom is thinner than Mary.
9687062	eng	It's important that he knows the truth.
9687067	eng	It's essential that he clearly define what the word means.
9687255	eng	I want to be able to communicate in English fluently.
9687439	eng	Yanni wants to be famous in Algeria.
9687748	eng	The man fell to the floor.
9688476	eng	The pressure cooker is a cooking utensil that closes hermetically.
9688592	eng	Did you find the killer?
9689342	eng	I only know what he's called.
9689761	eng	I won't force you to go and do that but it will have consequences if you won't.
9693056	eng	Which horse does the boy see?
9694991	eng	I know that someone has informed Tom about Mary's death. But why was that "someone" necessarily me?
9694999	eng	The two escort attendants watch over the bride; moreover, they know how to protect the bride from any spell. Nothing escapes their sharp eyes.
9695091	eng	This animal feeds on meat.
9695576	eng	We made sure that didn't happen.
9696178	eng	She became more beautiful as she got older.
9696389	eng	We should be in Australia by this time tomorrow.
9696447	eng	Are there any foods you don't like?
9696581	eng	There's no need to be afraid of change.
9696607	eng	When she's an adult, she'll be a famous pianist.
9698615	eng	Tom was able to get the cork out of the bottle.
9699075	eng	Tom isn't like his father. He's much more like his mother.
9699304	eng	Tom is picking blueberries.
9699376	eng	Yanni strapped the goat's leg to milk it.
9700130	eng	Why are you circling like that with your nose in the air?
9701324	eng	Yanni's new goat is still not used to getting milked.
9701787	eng	The leaves are turning yellow already.
9701869	eng	Be honest when you talk with me.
9702696	eng	Why do some months of the year have 30 days, others 31, and February 28 or 29?
9702824	eng	This is our last class.
9703426	eng	Could you add my name to that list?
9703478	eng	Tom wished that there were more trees on his property.
9703624	eng	Tom asked Mary to explain it to him again.
9703739	eng	You can't say I didn't warn you.
9704252	eng	Everyone should get a plate.
9704594	eng	Tom looked like he was going to faint.
9704984	eng	This is a lot of fun.
9705187	eng	Get here as quickly as possible.
9705506	eng	Do you have non-alcoholic drinks?
9705637	eng	Many people became homeless because of the earthquake.
9706059	eng	Somebody broke into my apartment.
9706125	eng	Let's eat everything.
9706299	eng	She lost her only son in a traffic accident.
9706408	eng	I don't know why I woke up so early.
9706449	eng	People drive on the right in Spain, and on the left in Japan.
9707960	eng	I strongly warn you against Tom. He is a malicious person.
9709230	eng	Start searching.
9709525	eng	You can learn a lot from books.
9709733	eng	Tom is waiting for Mary outside.
9711653	eng	Everyone will get everything they need.
9711766	eng	Tom and Mary played Ultimate Frisbee.
9711927	eng	Tom brushed his teeth while Mary brushed her hair.
9714431	eng	They had to sleep in the cold.
9714484	eng	Yanni feared that Skura was suicidal.
9714487	eng	It wasn't a big deal to me.
9714540	eng	Yanni lost his fortune.
9714556	eng	Yanni was working late into the night.
9714641	eng	Yanni wanted to get Skura out of Algeria.
9714813	eng	Yanni's reply was barely a whisper.
9715179	eng	Any religion or philosophy can be taken to excess.
9715664	eng	Tom isn't like other boys his age.
9716818	eng	You don't care about that kind of thing, do you?
9717515	eng	Haumea is a dwarf planet shaped like an egg.
9718688	eng	I will do that tomorrow.
9718760	eng	Now you should sleep well!
9718773	eng	Come visit us.
9722059	eng	I worked hard the whole day today.
9723705	eng	The man wore English clothes, but he wasn't English.
9724929	eng	They think that'll help the economy.
9725033	eng	Why don't you stay a bit longer?
9725202	eng	How many games do you have on your phone?
9725444	eng	Stay where you are and we'll come get you.
9725514	eng	Yanni knows that.
9725669	eng	Do you know where I am?
9726778	eng	What is the capital of Kyrgyzstan?
