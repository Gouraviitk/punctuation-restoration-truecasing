1277	eng	I have to go to sleep.
1280	eng	Today is June 18th and it is Muiriel's birthday!
1282	eng	Muiriel is 20 now.
1284	eng	I will be back soon.
1286	eng	I'm at a loss for words.
1287	eng	This is never going to end.
1290	eng	I was in the mountains.
1291	eng	Is it a recent picture?
1294	eng	Education in this world disappoints me.
1295	eng	You're in better shape than I am.
1296	eng	You are in my way.
1298	eng	This will cost €30.
1299	eng	I make €100 a day.
1300	eng	I may give up soon and just nap instead.
1301	eng	It's because you don't want to be alone.
1302	eng	That won't happen.
1303	eng	Sometimes he can be a strange guy.
1304	eng	I'll do my best not to disturb your studying.
1306	eng	I suppose it's different when you think about it over the long term.
1308	eng	I miss you.
1309	eng	I'll call them tomorrow when I come back.
1310	eng	I always liked mysterious characters more.
1311	eng	You should sleep.
1312	eng	I'm going to go.
1313	eng	I told them to send me another ticket.
1314	eng	You're so impatient with me.
1316	eng	I once wanted to be an astrophysicist.
1317	eng	I never liked biology.
1318	eng	The last person I told my idea to thought I was nuts.
1319	eng	If the world weren't in the shape it is now, I could trust anyone.
1320	eng	It is unfortunately true.
1321	eng	They are too busy fighting against each other to care for common ideals.
1322	eng	Most people think I'm crazy.
1324	eng	That's MY line!
1325	eng	He's kicking me!
1326	eng	Are you sure?
1327	eng	Then there is a problem...
1329	eng	Hurry up.
1330	eng	It doesn't surprise me.
1332	eng	For some reason I feel more alive at night.
1334	eng	Are you freaking kidding me?!
1335	eng	That's the stupidest thing I've ever said.
1336	eng	I don't want to be lame; I want to be cool!!
1337	eng	When I grow up, I want to be a king.
1338	eng	America is a lovely place to be, if you are here to earn money.
1339	eng	I'm so fat.
1341	eng	I'm gonna shoot him.
1343	eng	I'm just saying!
1344	eng	That was probably what influenced their decision.
1345	eng	I've always wondered what it'd be like to have siblings.
1346	eng	This is what I would have said.
1347	eng	It would take forever for me to explain everything.
1348	eng	That's because you're a girl.
1349	eng	Sometimes I can't help showing emotions.
1350	eng	It's a word I'd like to find a substitute for.
1351	eng	It would be something I'd have to program.
1352	eng	I don't intend to be selfish.
1353	eng	Let's consider the worst that could happen.
1354	eng	How many close friends do you have?
1355	eng	I may be antisocial, but it doesn't mean I don't talk to people.
1357	eng	I think it is best not to be impolite.
1358	eng	One can always find time.
1359	eng	I'd be unhappy, but I wouldn't kill myself.
1360	eng	Back in high school, I got up at 6 a.m. every morning.
1361	eng	When I woke up, I was sad.
1362	eng	That is somewhat explained at the end.
1363	eng	I thought you liked to learn new things.
1364	eng	Most people write about their daily life.
1368	eng	Why do you ask?
1369	eng	I am not an artist. I never had the knack for it.
1371	eng	I am a flawed person, but these are flaws that can easily be fixed.
1372	eng	Whenever I find something I like, it's too expensive.
1373	eng	How long did you stay?
1374	eng	Maybe it will be exactly the same for him.
1375	eng	Innocence is a beautiful thing.
1376	eng	Humans were never meant to live forever.
1377	eng	I don't want to lose my ideas, even though some of them are a bit extreme.
1378	eng	I think I have a theory about that.
1380	eng	You are saying you intentionally hide your good looks?
1381	eng	I do not have an account in these forums.
1382	eng	If anyone was to ask what the point of the story is, I really don't know.
1383	eng	I didn't know where it came from.
1384	eng	I think my living with you has influenced your way of living.
1385	eng	This is not important.
1386	eng	I didn't like it.
1387	eng	She's asking how that's possible.
1388	eng	You're just running away from life's problems.
1389	eng	If you look at the lyrics, they don't really mean much.
1392	eng	My physics teacher doesn't care if I skip classes.
1394	eng	I hate it when there are a lot of people.
1395	eng	I have to go to bed.
1396	eng	After that, I left, but then I realized that I forgot my backpack at their house.
1397	eng	I won't ask you anything else today.
1399	eng	Even though he apologized, I'm still furious.
1400	eng	The police will get you to find the bullets.
1401	eng	Thanks for having explained to me at last why people take me for an idiot.
1402	eng	That wasn't my intention.
1403	eng	Thanks for your explanation.
1404	eng	Theoretically, I'm doing math.
1406	eng	If you didn't know me that way then you simply didn't know me.
1407	eng	It almost scared me not to see you online for a whole day.
1408	eng	I don't know what you mean.
1409	eng	My computer has got to be useful for something.
1410	eng	You wanted to tell me about freedom?
1412	eng	If I wanted to scare you, I would tell you what I dreamt about a few weeks ago.
1416	eng	You're really not stupid.
1418	eng	I don't know how to demonstrate it, since it's too obvious!
1419	eng	I wouldn't have thought I would someday look up "Viagra" in Wikipedia.
1420	eng	Can it be phrased in another way?
1421	eng	No one will know.
1423	eng	It seems interesting to me.
1424	eng	Except that here, it's not so simple.
1425	eng	I like candlelight.
1426	eng	What did you answer?
1427	eng	No, he's not my new boyfriend.
1428	eng	It's too bad that I don't need to lose weight.
1429	eng	You never have class or what?!
1430	eng	I will play Sudoku then instead of continuing to bother you.
1431	eng	Where is the problem?
1433	eng	It's not much of a surprise, is it?
1435	eng	I don't like you anymore.
1436	eng	I am curious.
1437	eng	Congratulations!
1439	eng	Why don't you come visit us?
1440	eng	But the possibility seems unlikely.
1442	eng	I shouldn't have logged off.
1443	eng	I don't know what to do anymore.
1444	eng	It is inevitable that I go to France someday, I just don't know when.
1445	eng	I hate chemistry.
1446	eng	I didn't want this to happen.
1447	eng	You can probably guess what happens though.
1448	eng	Next thing you know, you'll be in the papers.
1449	eng	What other options do I have?
1450	eng	I am not much of a traveller.
1451	eng	I have nothing better to do.
1453	eng	Everyone has strengths and weaknesses.
1454	eng	Seriously though, episode 21 made me almost cry while laughing.
1455	eng	It only shows you're not a robot.
1456	eng	How could I be a robot? Robots don't dream.
1460	eng	What do you think I've been doing?
1462	eng	My mom doesn't speak English very well.
1463	eng	I don't speak French well enough!
1466	eng	How do you find food in outer space?
1467	eng	All you can do is trust one another.
1468	eng	Everyone wants to meet you. You're famous!
1469	eng	Why are you sorry for something you haven't done?
1470	eng	I utterly despise formal writing!
1471	eng	Foreign people intrigue me.
1472	eng	Whatever I do, she says I can do better.
1474	eng	You'd be surprised what you can learn in a week.
1475	eng	I don't have anyone who'd travel with me.
1476	eng	You're not fast enough.
1477	eng	Life is hard, but I am harder.
1479	eng	Stop it! You're making her feel uncomfortable!
1480	eng	Nothing is beautiful but the truth.
1481	eng	Tomorrow, he will land on the moon.
1482	eng	I don't speak Japanese.
1483	eng	This is a pun.
1484	eng	Nobody understands me.
1485	eng	I learned to live without her.
1486	eng	It's useless to keep on thinking any more.
1487	eng	I have too many things on my mind these days.
1488	eng	I just wanted to check my email.
1489	eng	Do you really need to ask the question to know the answer?
1490	eng	You can't expect me to always think of everything!
1492	eng	You really don't have the right priorities!
1493	eng	Don't expect others to think for you!
1495	eng	It's no use pretending to make me believe that I believe things you don't believe!
1497	eng	I'm so dumb... I'm trying to explain things to you that I don't understand myself.
1498	eng	Stop seeing me as a "normal" person!
1499	eng	Are you referring to me?
1500	eng	There will always be things I will never learn, I don't have eternity before me!
1501	eng	It can't be!
1502	eng	I wish I could care more about my grades but it seems that, at a certain point of my life, I decided they wouldn't be so important anymore.
1503	eng	"A rolling stone gathers no moss" is a proverb.
1505	eng	"Who is it?" "It's your mother."
1506	eng	"When will you be back?" "It all depends on the weather."
1507	eng	"What's the matter?" asked the little white rabbit.
1508	eng	"What's going on in the cave? I'm curious." "I have no idea."
1509	eng	We must learn to live together as brothers, or we will perish together as fools.
1510	eng	Uh... How's that working?
1511	eng	"To tell you the truth, I am scared of heights." "You are a coward!"
1514	eng	"This looks pretty interesting," Hiroshi says.
1515	eng	Their communication may be much more complex than we thought.
1516	eng	"The phone is ringing." "I'll get it."
1517	eng	"That's very nice of you," Willie answered.
1518	eng	"Thank you for helping me." "Don't mention it."
1519	eng	Someday I'll run like the wind.
1520	eng	"She likes music." "So do I."
1521	eng	Please don't cry.
1522	eng	Let me know if there is anything I can do.
1523	eng	It may be that the happiness awaiting us is not at all the sort of happiness we would want.
1524	eng	It is up to you to decide whether we will go there or not.
1525	eng	Class doesn't begin until eight-thirty.
1526	eng	I want a boat that will take me far away from here.
1528	eng	"Haven't we met somewhere before?" asked the student.
1529	eng	A Japanese would never do such a thing.
1530	eng	Allen is a poet.
1531	eng	The archer killed the deer.
1532	eng	Communism will never be reached in my lifetime.
1533	eng	Rye was called the grain of poverty.

1538	eng	If you don't eat, you die.
1539	eng	How do you spell "pretty"?
1540	eng	Why don't we go home?
1541	eng	I'm sorry, I can't stay long.
1542	eng	Ten years is a long time to wait.
1543	eng	"Why aren't you going?" "Because I don't want to."
1544	eng	One million people lost their lives in the war.
1547	eng	It is not rare at all to live over ninety years.
1549	eng	First, I'm going to do an outline of my new website.
1550	eng	Democracy is the worst form of government, except all the others that have been tried.
1551	eng	When you're beginning to look like the photo in your passport, you should go on a holiday.
1552	eng	It wasn't me, commissioner!
1553	eng	Oh, my white pants! And they were new.
1554	eng	With so many people around he naturally became a bit nervous.
1555	eng	When I left the train station, I saw a man.
1557	eng	You're an angel!
1558	eng	People from Madrid are weird.
1559	eng	Well, the night is quite long, isn't it?
1560	eng	You're lucky because he didn't bite you.
1561	eng	Did you miss me?
1563	eng	Are they all the same?
1565	eng	Where are the eggs, please?
1568	eng	That's a good idea!
1569	eng	Round trip? Only one-way.
1570	eng	It's a pity when somebody dies.
1571	eng	They were left speechless.
1573	eng	Pull into shape after washing.
1574	eng	Wash before first wearing.
1575	eng	Don't open before the train stops.
1578	eng	They say love is blind.
1580	eng	Math is like love: a simple idea, but it can get complicated.
1581	eng	The only useful answers are those that raise new questions.
1582	eng	To have doubts about oneself is the first sign of intelligence.
1583	eng	Poor is not the one who has too little, but the one who wants too much.
1584	eng	Seeing that you're not surprised, I think you must have known.
1585	eng	How long does it take to get to the station?
1586	eng	This will be a good souvenir of my trip around the United States.
1587	eng	Excuse me; allow me to point out three errors in the above article.
1589	eng	It is difficult to keep up a conversation with someone who only says "yes" and "no".
1590	eng	Do you speak Italian?
1591	eng	"I can't think with that noise," she said, as she stared at the typewriter.
1592	eng	It is said that "Hamlet" is the most interesting play ever written.
1594	eng	May I ask a question?
1595	eng	"How do you feel?" he inquired.
1596	eng	It's quite difficult to master French in 2 or 3 years.
1597	eng	It's impossible for me to explain it to you.
1598	eng	I don't want to spend the rest of my life regretting it.
1599	eng	It would be fun to see how things change over the years.
1600	eng	I would never have guessed that.
1601	eng	Imagination affects every aspect of our lives.
1602	eng	You'll forget about me someday.
1603	eng	That is rather unexpected.
1605	eng	I can't live without a TV.
1606	eng	I couldn't have done it without you. Thank you.
1607	eng	Nothing is achieved without effort.
1609	eng	Life without love is just totally pointless.
1610	eng	Let me know if I need to make any changes.
1612	eng	We can't sleep because of the noise.
1613	eng	Do you have a condom?
1615	eng	Do whatever he tells you.

1629	eng	Hey, I may have no money, but I still have my pride.
1630	eng	I have a dream.
1631	eng	This is my friend Rachel. We went to high school together.
1632	eng	The cost of life increased drastically.
1633	eng	All that which is invented, is true.
1634	eng	To be surprised, to wonder, is to begin to understand.
1636	eng	To be perfect she lacked just one defect.
1637	eng	And yet, the contrary is always true as well.
1638	eng	We don't see things as they are, but as we are.
1639	eng	The world is a den of crazies.
1640	eng	You opened up my eyes to what it's like when everything is right.
1641	eng	You found me where no one else was looking.
1643	eng	What do you mean you don't know?!
1644	eng	You look stupid.
1645	eng	I think I'm gonna go to sleep.
1646	eng	My name is Jack.
1647	eng	I like it very much.
1648	eng	We're meeting up tomorrow?

1651	eng	Is it far from here?
1652	eng	These things aren't mine!
1653	eng	Thanks, that's all.
1658	eng	Italy is a very beautiful country.

1662	eng	Is there a youth hostel near here?
1663	eng	Where are the showers?

1673	eng	"Pass me the salt, please." "Here you are."
1674	eng	There are too many things to do!
1676	eng	Come on, play with me, I'm so bored!
1678	eng	Stop asking me for a drink! Go get it yourself.
1679	eng	Thanks to you I've lost my appetite.
1680	eng	I really need to hit somebody.
1681	eng	Who doesn't know this problem?!
1682	eng	It has been so long since I last went to Disneyland with my family.
1685	eng	My friends always say I'm too calm, but my family always says I'm too annoying.
1686	eng	I hate those spiders. They're always there to freak me out when I'm cleaning.
1687	eng	So annoying... Now I get a headache whenever I use the computer!
1689	eng	It is very hot today.
1690	eng	Nobody came.

1696	eng	My eyes are an ocean in which my dreams are reflected.
1697	eng	You know the phrase, we reap what we sow. I have sown the wind and this is my storm.
1698	eng	Look at me when I talk to you!
1699	eng	What would the world be without women?
1700	eng	What if you gave a speech and nobody came?
1701	eng	I don't know what to say to make you feel better.
1702	eng	This is not my type.
1704	eng	How did you come up with this crazy idea?
1705	eng	I'm tired.
1707	eng	Speak more slowly, please!
1709	eng	When do we arrive?
1710	eng	The check, please.
1711	eng	And what are we going to do?
1712	eng	I have a headache.
1714	eng	I must admit that I snore.
1715	eng	Tonight we're going to church.
1718	eng	Call the police!

1738	eng	Computers make people stupid.
1739	eng	Don't ask what they think. Ask what they do.
1740	eng	When you're trying to prove something, it helps to know it's true.
1741	eng	What changes the world is communication, not information.
1742	eng	Most scientific breakthroughs are nothing else than the discovery of the obvious.
1743	eng	If you don't understand something, it's because you aren't aware of its context.
1745	eng	The key question is not what can I gain but what do I have to lose.

1769	eng	In a dictionary like this one there should be at least two sentences with "fridge".
1770	eng	Creationism is a pseudo-science.

2357	eng	I don't expect anything from you.
2358	eng	Wait in the waiting room.
2359	eng	More people get into trouble for things they say rather than for what they do.

2387	eng	You can't get lost in big cities; there are maps everywhere!
2388	eng	We are sorry, the person you are trying to contact is not available.
2390	eng	He came several times.
2392	eng	We must think about friends.
2393	eng	I'm going to take a bath.
2394	eng	It was raining when we left, but by the time we arrived, it was sunny.

2396	eng	If you eat too much, you'll become fat.

2412	eng	They quarreled.
2413	eng	I ate caviar.
2415	eng	This knife was very useful to me.
2416	eng	You took the wrong key.
2417	eng	I managed to get in.
2420	eng	I'll bring you the bill immediately.
2421	eng	Here is your change.
2422	eng	I'll pay by cheque.
2423	eng	Did you leave a tip?
2424	eng	Don't forget the ticket.
2425	eng	I'm sorry, I don't have change.
2427	eng	We have to expect the worst.
2428	eng	They don't even know why.
2429	eng	I want you to tell me the truth.
2430	eng	You arrived at the moment I left.
2431	eng	Muiriel likes to annoy me lately.

2435	eng	Florence is the most beautiful city in Italy.
2436	eng	On your feet, children!
2437	eng	I talked to friends.

2444	eng	Tell me what happened.
2445	eng	They are sensible girls.
2446	eng	How beautiful you are!
2447	eng	It's easier to have fun than to work.
2449	eng	It's more difficult than you think.
2450	eng	He told me he would go to Venice.
2451	eng	Who are those guys?
2454	eng	The spirit is willing, but the flesh is weak.
2456	eng	It seems to me that the train is late.
2457	eng	He learned the news while reading the newspaper.
2460	eng	Ask Trang if he's going out this evening.
2463	eng	Who said that? It's totally wrong!
2464	eng	When I was a child, I would spend hours reading alone in my room.
2465	eng	Wolves won't usually attack people.
2467	eng	Please will you close the door when you go out.
2469	eng	Ah! If I were rich, I'd buy myself a house in Spain.
2470	eng	I wish she would stop playing that stupid music.
2471	eng	I hope he'll be able to come! I'd like to see him.
2472	eng	They will never accept; it's too far.

2474	eng	I'd rather be a bird than a fish.

2477	eng	Every man's work, whether it be literature or music or a picture or architecture or anything else, is always a portrait of himself.
2478	eng	When we seek to discover the best in others, we somehow bring out the best in ourselves.
2479	eng	Forget it. It's not worth it.
2480	eng	We're going to eat a lot tonight so I hope you're not on a diet.
3257	eng	For once in my life I'm doing a good deed... And it is useless.
4719	eng	You need not telephone me.
4721	eng	Brian repeatedly told Chris that he owed him a pretty large amount of money.
4722	eng	How dare you say such a thing to me?
4723	eng	You ask me to do the impossible.
4724	eng	I brought you a little something.
4908	eng	You are no better at remembering things than I am.
4918	eng	You have the same racket as I have.
4919	eng	She has as many books as I.
5942	eng	We have to take him to the hospital immediately; he is seriously injured!
5943	eng	Go and speak to my colleague.
5944	eng	Tell me about it!
5950	eng	Let's not be in too much of a hurry.
5973	eng	Does it also work without registration?
5975	eng	In which folder did you save the file?
5992	eng	I heard a cotton candy shop has just opened. Let's go, dudes.
5999	eng	I have to take medicine.
6002	eng	Please do not take photos here.
6008	eng	I'm taking a walk in a park.
6011	eng	My hobby is to listen to music.
6019	eng	I work even on Sunday.
6022	eng	He's not working much at the moment.
6024	eng	It happened a long time ago.
6026	eng	Where have you been?
6028	eng	Here comes the bride!
6032	eng	What have you been doing all this time!
6034	eng	It's been snowing all night.
6036	eng	It's been ten years since we last met.
6041	eng	How come you know so much about Japanese history?
6043	eng	Could you turn on the light, please?
6044	eng	She's selling drugs at concerts.
6047	eng	Turn right at the crossroad.
6048	eng	I buried my dog at the pet cemetery.
6050	eng	They forgot to lock the door.
6054	eng	He was born on July 28th, 1888.
6088	eng	Will you listen to me for a few minutes?
6110	eng	How did your interview go?
6114	eng	I'm going to sit on the bench over there next to the street lamp.
6117	eng	I have to write a letter. Do you have some paper?
6124	eng	Could you do me a favour please?
6128	eng	No, I'm not mad at you, I'm just disappointed.
6130	eng	She is mad at me.
6133	eng	I can't believe my eyes.
6135	eng	I couldn't say when exactly in my life it occurred to me that I would be a pilot someday.
6136	eng	An eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth.
6138	eng	She has always done her best to make their life easier.
6140	eng	I've got mosquito bites all over my arm.
6143	eng	During winter I sleep with two blankets.
6314	eng	You are to come with me.
7279	eng	Are you angry at what I said?
7656	eng	Can you justify the use of violence?
8389	eng	Can you do bookkeeping?
8390	eng	You have no sense of direction.
8861	eng	You should know better than to ask a lady her age.
9580	eng	You shouldn't do things by halves.
9581	eng	You should pay your rent in advance.
9582	eng	You must keep your room clean.
9583	eng	You must take off your hat in the room.
9584	eng	You are wavering.
9585	eng	Have you ever climbed Mt. Fuji?
9586	eng	Your undaunted spirit will carry you through.
9587	eng	You should take care of your sick mother.
9588	eng	You have to learn standard English.
9589	eng	You have bought more postage stamps than are necessary.
9590	eng	You are not at all wrong.
9591	eng	Have you ever traveled in a plane?
9593	eng	You are idle to the bone.
9594	eng	Can you keep a secret?
9595	eng	Since you look tired, you had better take a rest.
9596	eng	Now that you are tired, you'd better rest.
9597	eng	You are tired, and so am I.
